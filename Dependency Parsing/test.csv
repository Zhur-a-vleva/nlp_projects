Impedance 855.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 20 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state and intravenous sedation was provided as needed with Versed and fentanyl. The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein. The patient will be observed overnight and will go home in the morning."
2,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Penoscrotal abscess.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Penoscrotal abscess.,OPERATION: , Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess.  Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed.  The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis.  For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future.  Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed.  The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAIL OF THE OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation.  The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection.  The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out.  The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets.  The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis.,Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal.  The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged.  There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder.  There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder.  Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal.  There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma.  Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis.  Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed.  After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix.  The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.  Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place.  Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied.  The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia."
3,"INDICATIONS:,  Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting.,PROCEDURE DONE:,  Adenosine Myoview stress test.,STRESS ECG RESULTS:,  The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140 mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes.  The baseline resting electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute.  Underlying atrial fibrillation noted, very wide QRS complexes.  The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with adenosine infusion."
4,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.  The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples.  Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia.  A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position.  Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint.  Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately.  The patient was awakened.  He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity.  He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."
5,"Informed written consent has been obtained from the patient.  I explained the procedure to her prior to initiation of such.  The appropriate time-out procedure as per Medical Center protocol was performed prior to the procedure being begun while the patient was actively participating with appropriate identification of the patient, procedure, physician, documentation, position.  There were no safety concerns noted by staff nor myself.,REST ECHO:,  EF 60%.  No wall motion abnormalities.  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with mild ST depressions.  The patient exercised for 7 minutes 30 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol, exceeding target heart rate; no angina nor significant ECG changes seen.  Peak stress echo imaging shows EF of 75%, no regional wall motion abnormalities.  There was resting hypertension noted, systolic of approximately 152 mmHg with appropriate response of blood pressure to exercise.  No dysrhythmias noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.

Resting hypertension with appropriate response of blood pressure to exercise.,These results have been discussed with the patient.  Other management as per the hospital-based internal medicine service.,To be clear, there were no complications of this procedure."
6,"DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: , Gastrointestinal bleed.,DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE,1. Gastrointestinal bleed, source undetermined, but possibly due to internal hemorrhoids.,2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.,3. Hypothyroidism.,PROCEDURE:,  Colonoscopy.,FINDINGS:,  Poor prep with friable internal hemorrhoids, but no gross lesions, no source of bleed.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the emergency room by Dr. X. He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood.  Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy.  A bowel prep was done.  H&Hs were stable.  His most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning.  His H&H at admission was 41/14.3.  The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding.  His vital signs are stable.  He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid.  His Plavix is discontinued.  He is given IV Protonix.  I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec.,The patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8.  Chemistry panel was unremarkable.  The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today.  He tolerated it well and is being discharged home.  He will be followed closely as an outpatient.  He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission.  He will hold his Plavix for now.  They will call me for further dark stools and will avoid Pepto-Bismol.  They will follow up in the office on Thursday."
7,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,2.  Hiatal hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,2.  Hiatal hernia.,3.  Enterogastritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, photography, and biopsy.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient has a history of epigastric abdominal pain, persistent in nature.  She has a history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, takes Pepcid frequently.  She has had a history of hiatal hernia.  She is being evaluated at this time for disease process.  She does not have much response from Protonix.,Upon endoscopy, the gastroesophageal junction is approximately 40 cm.  There appeared to be some inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction and a small 1 cm to 2 cm hiatal hernia.  There is no advancement of the gastric mucosa up into the lower one-third of the esophagus.  However there appeared to be inflammation as stated previously in the gastroesophageal junction.  There was some mild inflammation at the antrum of the stomach.  The fundus of the stomach was within normal limits.  The cardia showed some laxity to the lower esophageal sphincter.  The pylorus is concentric.  The duodenal bulb and sweep are within normal limits.  No ulcers or erosions.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient is taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position.  The patient was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed.  Olympus videoscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and upon deglutition passed into the esophagus.  Using air insufflation, panendoscope was advanced down the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and sweep and the above gross findings were noted.  Panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel.  Photographs were taken with the pathology present.  Biopsy was obtained of the antrum of the stomach and also CLO test.  The biopsy is also obtained of the gastroesophageal junction at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions to rule out occult Barrett's esophagitis.  Air was aspirated from the stomach and the panendoscope was removed.  The patient sent to recovery room in stable condition."
8,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
9,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Pelvic mass.,2.  Suspected right ovarian cyst.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Pelvic mass.,2.  Suspected right ovarian cyst.,PROCEDURES,1.  Exploratory laparotomy.,2.  Extensive lysis of adhesions.,3.  Right salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 200 mL,SPECIMENS:  ,Right tube and ovary.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , Extensive adhesive disease with the omentum and bowel walling of the entire pelvis, which required more than 45 minutes of operating time in order to establish visualization and to clear the bowel and other important structures from the ovarian cyst, tube, and ovary in order to remove them.  The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass.  Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions.  Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid.  Cyst wall, tube, and ovary were stripped away from the bowel.  Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube.  There was excellent postoperative hemostasis.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient's prior incision.  Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached.  Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures.  At this point, the extensive adhesive disease was noted, again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery.  The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient's right side developing a window.  This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum.  A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course.  Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst.  Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst.  Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment, the cyst was ruptured.  Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated.  The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient's small and large bowel.  Once the bowel was freed, the remnants of round ligament was identified, elevated, and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space.,The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels, which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels, but superior to the course of the ureter.  This pedicle was doubly clamped, transected, and tied with a free tie of #2-0 Vicryl.  A suture ligature of #0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle.  The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary, which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum.  Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels.  However, a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur, which was clamped with a right-angle clamp, and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted.  Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed.,The opposite tube and ovary were identified, were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube.  Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal.  It was then left in situ.  Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery.  The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution.  The peritoneal edges were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle, and the ovarian vessel pedicle.  The areas of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease, it was carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis was noted.,All instruments and packs removed from the patient's abdomen.  The abdomen was closed with a running mattress closure of #0 PDS, beginning at the superior aspect of the incision, and extending inferiorly.  Excellent closure of the incision was noted.  The subcutaneous tissues were then copiously irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved with the use of cautery.  Subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted sutures of #0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with staples.,Incision was sterilely clean and dressed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  All counts were noted correct times three."
10,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test"
11,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  This is a routine return appointment for this 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation.  Her chief complaint today is shortness of breath.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I last saw her in 09/2008.  Since then, she has been admitted to ABCD Hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode.  She was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation.  She was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her.  They wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one's great surprise.  My plan advent is to control her heart rate.  This has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid.  We will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation.  She may need to have a pacemaker placed and her AV node ablated if this does not work.,She notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights.  I think these are manifestations of heart failure.  She has peripheral edema.  She is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block.  I believe she takes her medications as directed, but I am never sure she actually is taking them correctly.  In any case, she did not bring her medications with her today.,Today, she had an ECG which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute.  There is a nonspecific IVCD.  This is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster.  In addition, I reviewed her echocardiogram done at XYZ.  Her ejection fraction is 50% and she has paradoxical septal motion.  Her right ventricular systolic pressure is normal.  There are no significant valvular abnormalities.,MEDICATIONS:  ,1.  Fosamax - 70 mg weekly.,2.  Lisinopril - 20 mg daily.,3.  Metformin - 850 mg daily.,4.  Amlodipine - 5 mg daily.,5.  Metoprolol - 150 mg twice daily.,6.  Warfarin - 5 mg daily.,7.  Furosemide - none.,8.  Potassium - none.,9.  Magnesium oxide - 200 mg daily.,ALLERGIES: , Denied.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On my comprehensive cardiovascular examination, she again looks the same which is in heart failure.  Her blood pressure today was 130/60 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular.  She is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 158 pounds from when I saw her last visit.  She is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored.  Eyelids are normal.  She has vitiligo.  Pupils are round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric.  There is no oral thrush or central cyanosis.  She has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck, the left being worse than the right.  The jugular venous pressure is elevated.  Carotids are brisk are without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  The precordium is quiet.  The rhythm is irregularly irregular.  She has a variable first and second heart sounds.  No murmurs today.  Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses, although she does have hepatojugular reflux.  She has no clubbing or cyanosis, but does have 1+ peripheral edema.  Distal pulses are good.  On neurological examination, her mentation is normal.  Her mood and affect are normal.  She is oriented to person, place, and time.,ASSESSMENTS: , She has chronic atrial fibrillation and heart failure now.,PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated and the plan is rate control.,2.  Heart failure and she needs more diuretic.,3.  High blood pressure controlled.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.,6.  Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.,7.  History of alcohol abuse.,8.  Osteoporosis.,9.  Normal left ventricular function.,PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS: , None today.,PLANS: , I have restarted her Lasix at 80 mg daily and I have asked her to return in about 10 days to the heart failure clinic.  There, I would like them to recheck her heart rate and if still elevated, and she is truly on 150 mg of metoprolol twice a day, one could switch her amlodipine from 5 mg daily to diltiazem 120 mg daily.  If this does not work, in terms of controlling her heart rate, then she will need to have a pacemaker and her AV node ablated.,Thank you for asking me to participate in her care.,MEDICATION CHANGES: , See the above."
12,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.  Felodipine 10 mg once a day.,5.  Klor-Con 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.,6.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily presumably for GERD.,7.  MiraLax 17 g p.o. daily.,8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN.  IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist."
13,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: ,  The patient is a patient well known to my service.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit."

16,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart.""  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and ""thrown two and a half city blocks.""  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.  When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and ""tunnel vision"" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was ""spazzing out"" on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.

19,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Modified radical mastectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.  The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

23,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: , This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007.  While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8.  The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.  He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months.  Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout.  The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial.  The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet was let down.  The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss was 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours."
24,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right hemothorax.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right hemothorax.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Insertion of a #32 French chest tube on the right hemithorax.,ANESTHESIA: , 1% Lidocaine and sedation.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  This is a 54-year-old female with a newly diagnosed carcinoma of the cervix.  The patient is to have an Infuse-A-Port insertion today.  Postoperatively from that, she started having a blood tinged pink frothy sputum.  Chest x-ray was obtained and showed evidence of a hemothorax on the right hand side, opposite side of the Infuse-A-Port and a wider mediastinum.  The decision was made to place a chest tube in the right hemithorax to allow for the patient to be stable for transfer out of the operating room.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The area was anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine solution.  The patient was given sedation.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an incision approximately 1.5 cm long.  Then a curved scissor was used to dissect down to the level of the rib.  A blunt peon was then used to again enter into the right hemithorax.  Immediately a blood tinged effusion was released.  The chest tube was placed and directed in a posterior and superior direction.  The chest tube was hooked up to the Pleur-evac device which was ________ tip suction.  The chest tube was tied in with a #0 silk suture in a U-stitch fashion.  It was sutured in place with sterile dressing and silk tape.  The patient tolerated this procedure well.  We will obtain a chest x-ray in postop to ensure proper placement and continue to follow the patient very closely."
25,"PROCEDURES:,1.  Release of ventral chordee.,2.  Circumcision.,3.  Repair of partial duplication of urethral meatus.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is an 11-month-old baby boy who presented for evaluation of a duplicated urethral meatus as well as ventral chordee and dorsal prepuce hooding.  He is here electively for surgical correction.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought back into operating room 35.  After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis.  At this point, we probed both urethral meatus.  Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus.  At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter.  We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful.  We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication.  At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors.  We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans.,At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee.  Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision.  Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans.  Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture.  Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry.  This ended the procedure.  ,DRAINS:,  None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,URINE OUTPUT:  ,Unrecorded.,COMPLICATIONS: , None apparent.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient will now go under the care of Dr. XYZ, Plastic Surgery, for excision of scalp hemangioma."
26,"A 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  Through this a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  The abdomen was filled with approximately 2 liters of CO2 gas.  The Veress needle was withdrawn.  A trocar sleeve was placed through the incision into the abdominal cavity.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with the laparoscope.  A 1 cm suprapubic skin incision was made.  Through this a second trocar sleeve was placed into the abdominal cavity using direct observation with the laparoscope.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with a probe.,The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position, and the bowel was pushed out of the pelvis.  Upon visualization of the pelvis organs, the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal.  The probe was withdrawn and replaced with the bipolar cautery instrument.  The right fallopian tube was grasped approximately 1 cm distal to the cornual region of the uterus.  Electrical current was applied to the tube at this point and fulgurated.  The tube was then regrasped just distal to this and refulgurated.  It was then regrasped just distal to the lateral point and refulgurated again.  The same procedure was then carried out on the opposite tube.  The bipolar cautery instrument was withdrawn and replaced with the probe.  The fallopian tubes were again traced to their fimbriated ends to confirm the burn points on the tubes.  The upper abdomen was visualized, and the liver surface was normal.  The gas was allowed to escape from the abdomen, and the instruments were removed.  The skin incisions were repaired.  The instruments were removed from the vagina.,There were no complications to the procedure.  Blood loss was minimal.  The patient went to the postanesthesia recovery room in stable condition."
27,"CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two."

29,"CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis.  Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona.  The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia.  Next, the foreskin was retracted.  Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona.  The intervening foreskin was excised.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock.  The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges.  Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure.

33,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,DDDR permanent pacemaker.,INDICATION: , Tachybrady syndrome.,PROCEDURE:,  After all risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right subclavian region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the left subclavian vein.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18-gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The needle was then removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was secured to the field.  A second #18 gauze Argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein and once again a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  Likewise, the needle was removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was then secured to the field.  Next, a #15-knife blade was used to make a 1 to 1.5 inch linear incision over the area.  A #11-knife blade was used to make a deeper incision.  Hemostasis was made complete.  The edges of the incision were grasped and retracted.  Using Metzenbaum scissors, dissection was carried down to the pectoralis muscle fascial plane.  Digital blunt dissection was used to make a pacemaker pocket large enough to accommodate the pacemaker generator.  Metzenbaum scissors were then used to dissect cephalad to expose the guide wires.  The guidewires were then pulled through the pacemaker pocket.  One guidewire was secured to the field.,A bloodless introducer sheath was then advanced over a guidewire into the vascular lumen under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  Next, a ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium.  The pacemaker lead was then placed in the appropriate position in the right ventricle.  Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  The lead was sewn at the pectoralis muscle plane using #2-0 silk suture in an interrupted stitch fashion around the ________.  Pacing and sensing threshold were then reconfirmed.  Next, a second bloodless introducer sheath was advanced over the second guidewire into the vascular lumen.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was passed into the right atrium.  The sheath was then turned away in standard fashion.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was then placed in the appropriate position.  Pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  The lead was sewn to the pectoralis muscle facial plane utilizing #2-0 silk suture around the ________.  Sensing and pacing thresholds were then reconfirmed.  The leads were wiped free of blood and placed into the pacemaker generator.  The pacemaker generator leads were then placed into pocket with the leads posteriorly.  The deep tissues were closed utilizing #2-0 Chromic suture in an interrupted stitch fashion.  A #4-0 undyed Vicryl was then used to close the subcutaneous tissue in a continuous subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips overlaid.  A sterile gauge dressing was placed over the site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Catheterization Room in stable and satisfactory condition.,PACEMAKER DATA (GENERATOR DATA):,Manufacturer:  Medtronics.,Model:  Sigma.,Model #:  1234.,Serial #:  123456789.,LEAD INFORMATION:,Right Atrial Lead:,Manufacturer:  Medtronics.,Model #:  1234.,Serial #:  123456789.,VENTRICULAR LEAD:,Manufacturer:  Medtronics.,Model #:  1234.,Serial #:  123456789.,PACING AND SENSING THRESHOLDS:,Right Atrial Bipolar Lead:  Pulse width 0.50 milliseconds, impedance 518 ohms, P-wave sensing 2.2 millivolts, polarity is bipolar.,Ventricular Bipolar Lead:  Pulse width 0.50 milliseconds, voltage 0.7 volts, current 1.5 milliamps, impedance 655 ohms, R-wave sensing 9.7 millivolts, polarity is bipolar.,PARAMETER SETTINGS:,  Pacing mode DDDR:  Mode switch is on, low rate 60, upper 120, ________ is 33.0 milliseconds.,IMPRESSION:,  Successful implantation of DDDR permanent pacemaker.,PLAN:,1.

34,"TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant with penetrating keratoplasty.,2.  A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.

Corneal edema.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,SPECIMEN:  ,1.  Donor corneal swab sent to Microbiology.,2.  Donor corneal scar rim sent to Eye Pathology.,3.  The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist."
35,"She was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change.  Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000.  A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change.  There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.  At this juncture, she does not appear to need an intubation.  Pending chest x-ray, she may require additional IV furosemide."

Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,2.  Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.,PROCEDURE:,  He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well."
37,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart catheterization.,2.  Bilateral selective coronary angiography.,ANESTHESIA: , 1% lidocaine and IV sedation, including fentanyl 25 mcg.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 65-year-old male with known moderate mitral regurgitation with partial flail of the P2 and P3 gallops who underwent outpatient evaluation for increasingly severed decreased functional capacity and retrosternal chest pain that was aggravated by exertion and decreased with rest.  It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain.  He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5.  Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease.  He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.,The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin.  The needle was removed and a pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis.  The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter.  The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was carefully engaged and using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary artery was evaluated in both diagonal views.  This catheter was removed.  The sheath was flushed the final time.  The patient was taken to the postcatheterization holding area in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:,  This vessel is seen to be heavily calcified throughout its course.  Begins as a moderate caliber vessel.  There is a 60% stenosis in the distal portion with extension of the lesion to the ostium and proximal portions of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery.,LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY:,  This vessel is heavily calcified in its proximal portion.  It is of moderate caliber and seen post anteriorly in the intraventricular groove and wraps around the apex.  There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal portion and 90% ostial stenosis in the first and second anterolateral branches.  There is sequential 80% and 90% stenosis in the mid-portion of the vessel.  Otherwise, the LAD is seen to be diffusely diseased.,LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY:  ,This vessel is also calcified in its proximal portion.

38,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rotator cuff tear, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion (peel-back), right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."

A time-out process was followed.  Antibiotics were given.  Then, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated.  The right subclavian vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  Then using the Seldinger technique, the catheter part of the port, which was a single-lumen port, was passed through the introducer under x-ray guidance and placed in the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.,A pocket had been fashioned and a single-lumen drum of the port was connected to the catheter, which had been trimmed and affixed to the pectoralis fascia with couple of sutures of Vicryl.  Then, the fascia was closed using subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  The drum was aspirated and irrigated with heparinized saline and then was put in the pocket and the skin was closed.  A dressing was applied including the needle and the port with the catheter so that the floor could use the catheter right away.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  A chest x-ray was performed that showed that there were no complications of procedure and that the catheter was in right place."

The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services."

In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage was obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack was removed.  An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned.  The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition."

Reversal of Hartmann's colostomy.,4.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy.,5.  Cystoscopy with left ureteral stent.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old gentleman who had a previous perforated diverticula.  Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.,The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization.  The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure.  _____ were performed.  Lysis of adhesions were performed.  Reversal of colostomy and EEA anastomosis #29 Ethicon."
44,"HISTORY: , The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.  She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend.,This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside."

He was placed in the supine position on an OR table.  His arms were carefully taped down.  He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A 4-cm incision was made obliquely over the left side of his neck.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the platysma.  The platysma was incised using electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was done to create a plane between the strap muscles and the sternoclavicular mastoid muscle.  This allowed us to get right down on to the anterior cervical spine.  Blunt dissection was done to sweep off the longus colli.  We isolated the C7-T1 interspace.  An x-ray was taken to verify; we were indeed at the C7-T1 interspace.,Shadow-Line retractor was placed as well as Caspar pins.  This provided very, very good access to the C7-T1 disk.,At this point, the operating microscope was brought into the decompression.,A thorough and aggressive C7-T1 discectomy was done using a succession of curettes, pituitary rongeur, 4-mm cutting bur and a #2 Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the discectomy, the cartilaginous endplates were carefully removed using 4-mm cutting burr.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was carefully resected using #2 Kerrison rongeur.  Left-sided C8 foraminotomy was accomplished using nerve hook and a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the decompression, there was no further compression on the left C8 nerve root.,A Synthes cortical cancellous ____________ bone was placed in the interspace.  Sofamor Danek Atlantis plate was then placed over the interspace and four screws were placed, two in the body of C7 and two in the body of T1.  An x-ray was taken.  It showed good placement of the plate and screws.,A deep drain was placed.  The platysma layer was closed in running fashion using #1 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed in an interrupted fashion using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed in a running fashion using 4-0 Monocryl.  Steri-Strips and dressings were applied.  All counts were correct.  There were no complications."

The patient had oligohydramnios and also when placed on the monitor had nonreassuring fetal heart rate with late deceleration.  Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Skin edges reapproximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The uterus was evacuated of any remaining clots vaginally.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct."

Creation of additional arthrodesis using allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein at C3-C4.,12.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6.  There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5.  C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels.  Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages.,The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the neck crease.  Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained.  A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization.,Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space.  The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.  The operating microscope was then utilized.,Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed.  I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen.  There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact.  However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.,The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5.  I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces.  The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.  Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches.,Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space.  Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord.  I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord.  This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved.,Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4.  Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate.  The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush.  The holes were drilled and the screws were placed.  Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6.  All eight screws had good purchase.  The locking screws were tightly applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,Attention was turned to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.  There were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue."

The lesser trochanter was intact.  The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration.  The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone.  The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment.  Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture.  She denied any history of fall or trauma.  The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment.  Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed.  Treatment options were reviewed.  No guarantees have been made or implied.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Time-out procedure was called.  Antibiotics were infused.,A standard posterolateral approach was made.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus.  This was then incised along the line of the incision.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Charnley retractor was positioned.  The trochanter was intact.  The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor.  The piriformis and minimus junction was identified.  The minimus was also reflected along with the medius.  Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion.  Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed.  A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair.  Fracture site was exposed.  The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type.  Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew.  The head size was measured to be 43 mm.  Bony fragments were removed.  The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated.  A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability.  The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration.  This was sent to the pathology.  The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem.  An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis.  The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter.  There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter.  The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder.  The fracture site was well exposed.  Satisfactory lateralization was performed.  Attention was for the reaming process.  Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal.  At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted.  Appropriate anteversion was positioned.  The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation.  The bony edges were trimmed.  The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well.  There was no evidence of any subsidence.  At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length.  The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory.  The hip was well reduced without any difficulty.  The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory.  The shuck was less than 1 mm.  Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg.  Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation.  Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees.  After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed.  The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely.  At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed.  The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected.  Centralizer was positioned.  The cement restrictor was inserted.  Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried.  Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed.  The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured.  The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator.  All the cement debris was removed.,Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head.  Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion.  It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory.  I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal.  The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation.  There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation.  I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable.  At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced.  Range of motion and stability was as above.  Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis.  This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster.  Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl.  The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures.  Skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed.  Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted."

61,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,TITLE OF THE PROCEDURE: , Right carpal tunnel release.,COMPLICATIONS:,  There were no complications during the procedure.,SPECIMEN:  ,The specimen was sent to pathology.,INSTRUMENTS: , All counts were correct at the end of the case and no complications were encountered.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is a 69-year-old female who have been complaining of right hand pain, which was steadily getting worse over a prolonged period of time.  The patient had tried nonoperative therapy, which did not assist the patient.  The patient had previous diagnosis of carpal tunnel and EMG showed compression of the right median nerve.  As a result of these findings, the patient was sent to my office presenting with this history and was carefully evaluated.  On initial evaluation, the patient had the symptomology of carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient at the time had the risks, benefits, and alternatives thoroughly explained to her.  All questions were answered.  No guarantees were given.  The patient had agreed to the surgical procedure and the postoperative rehabilitation as needed.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given sedation.  The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications."

Cervical facial rhytidectomy with purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.,ASSISTANT:  ,None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and prepped with general endotracheal anesthesia.  Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The cheek flap was brought back posteriorly and the cervical flap posteriorly and superiorly with redundant skin on the right massaged and closed.  The skin of the cheek and neck were resected which was redundant after the ***** posteriorly and superiorly in the neck and transversely in the cheek.,Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 PDS suture of deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis of the skin was closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Drains were placed prior to final closure.  A 7-mm flat Jackson-Pratt was then secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Dressing consisting of fluffs and Kerlix and a 4-inch Ace were applied to support mildly compressive dressing.  Scleral eye protectors were removed.  Maxitrol eye ointment was placed followed by Swiss therapy eye pads.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and she returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition with Foley catheter and Pneumatic compression stockings, TED hose, two Jackson-Pratt drains, and an IV."
63,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.  Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

The hymen was found to be intact.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a 4 cm left adnexal mass, which appeared fluid filled.  There were a few calcifications on the surface of the mass.  The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  The uterus appeared normal in size.  There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm.  She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.

66,"DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM,REASON FOR EXAM: , Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.,Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.,The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.,The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.,No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.,The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.,The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.,The wall motion score was unchanged.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,2.

Xylocaine 1% was injected and then a 12-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the medial scapular line about the eighth intercostal space.  It was difficult to draw fluid by syringe, but we connected the system to a plastic bag and by gravity started draining at least 400 mL while we were in the minor OR.  Samples were sent for culture and sensitivity, aerobic and anaerobic.,The patient and I decided to admit him for a period of observation at least overnight.,He tolerated the procedure well and the postprocedure chest x-ray showed no complications."
68,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation."

An infraumbilical incision was made, and Veress needle placed without difficulty.  Gas was entered into the abdomen at two liters.  The laparoscope was entered, and the abdomen was visualized.  The second puncture site was made, and the second trocar placed without difficulty.  The cyst was noted on the left, a 3-cm, ovarian cyst.  This was needled, and a hole cut in it with the scissors.  Hemostasis was intact.  Instruments were removed.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition."
70,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 mL.,HEMOSTASIS:,  Right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 35 minutes.,MATERIALS USED: , 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and two partially threaded cannulated screws from 3.0 OsteoMed System for internal fixation.,INJECTABLES:  ,Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."

Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.

73,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  PICC line insertion.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was identified by myself on presentation to the angiography suite.  His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure nicely and was discharged from Angiography in satisfactory condition back to the general floor.  We may make another attempt in the near future using a different approach.,"

First, a shoulder roll was placed, 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the old scar, natural skin fold, and Betadine prep.  Sterile dressing was placed.  The laryngeal monitoring was noted to be working fine.  Then, an incision was made in this area in a curvilinear fashion through the old scar, taken through the fat and the platysma level.  The strap muscles were found and there was scar tissue along the trachea and the strap muscles were elevated off of the left thyroid, the thyroid gland was then found.  Then, using bipolar cautery and a Coblation dissector, the thyroid gland inferiorly was dissected off and the parathyroid gland was left inferiorly and there was scar tissue that was released and laterally, the thyroid gland was released, then came into the Berry ligaments.  The Berry ligament was dissected off and the gland came off all the way to the superior and inferior thyroid vessels, which were crossed with the Harmonic scalpel and removed.  No bleeding was seen.  There was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a 4-0 Vicryl suture ligature.  After this was completed, on examining the specimen, there appeared to be a lobule on it and it was sent off as possibly parathyroid, therefore it was reimplanted in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region using the silk suture ligature.  After this was completed, no bleeding was seen.  The laryngeal nerve could be seen and intact and then Rubber band  drain was placed throughout the neck along the thyroid bed and 4-0 Vicryl was used to close the strap muscles in an interrupted fashion along with the platysma region and subcutaneous region and a running 5-0 nylon was used to close the skin and Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed along the skin edges and then on awakening, both laryngeal nerves were working normally.  Procedure was then terminated at that time."

79,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest, consolidation of the left lung, lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses, and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,FINDINGS: , The patient has a complex history, which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two CAT scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax.  There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition."

I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.

Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.

She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  His abdomen was prepped and draped in a standard, sterile surgical fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  Marcaine was injected into his umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced in his abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through his umbilicus.  A 5-mm port was then placed just to the right side of the umbilicus.  Another 5-mm port was placed just suprapubic in the midline.  Upon inspection of the cecum, I was able find an inflamed and indurated appendix.  I was able to clear the mesentery at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum.  I fired a white load stapler across the appendix at its base and fired a grey load stapler across the mesentery, and thereby divided the mesentery and freed the appendix.  I put the appendix in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus.  I irrigated out the abdomen.  I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason and closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."

He underwent an IVP, which demonstrated enlarged prostate and normal upper tracts.  Cystoscopy in the office demonstrated a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor.  He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.

The patient's uterus is intact, bladder is intact.,HISTORY: , The patient is an approximately 25-year-old Caucasian female with gravida-4, para-1-0-2-1.  The patient's last menstrual period was in December of 2002 with a foreseeable due date on 09/16/03 confirmed by ultrasound.,The patient has a history of herpes simplex virus to which there is no active prodromal and no evidence of lesions.  The patient has a history of IVDA and contracted hepatitis C with slightly elevated liver transaminases.  The patient had been seen through our office for prenatal care.  The patient is on Valtrex.  The patient was found to be 3 cm about 40%, 0 to 9 engaged.  Bag of waters was ruptured.  She was on Pitocin.  She was contracting appropriately for a couple of hours or so with appropriate ________.  There was no cervical change noted.  Most probably because there was a sink vertex and that the head was too large to descend into the pelvis.  The patient was advised of this and we recommended cesarean section.  She agreed.  We discussed the surgery, foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment, the procedure itself, and recovery in layman's terms.  The patient's questions were answered.  I personally made sure that she understood every aspect of the consent and that she was comfortable with the understanding of what would transpire.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was then taken back to operative suite.  She was given anesthetic and sterilely prepped and draped.  Pfannenstiel incision was used.  A second knife was used to carry the incision down to the anterior rectus fascia.  Anterior rectus fascia was incised in the midline and carried bilaterally and the fascia was lifted off the underlying musculature.  The rectus muscles were separated.  The patient's peritoneum tented up towards the umbilicus and we entered the abdominal cavity.  There was a very thin lower uterine segment.  There seemed to be quite a large baby.  The patient had a small nick in the uterus.  Following the blunt end of the bladder knife going through the innermost layer of the myometrium and into the endometrial cavity, clear amniotic fluid was obtained.  A blunt low transverse cervical incision was made.  Following this, we placed a ________ on the very large fetal head.  The head was delivered following which we were able to deliver a large baby girl, 9 lb, good at tone and cry.  The patient then underwent removal of the placenta after the cord blood and ABG were taken.  The patient's uterus was examined.  There appeared to be no retained products.  The patient's uterine incision was reapproximated and sutured with #0 Vicryl in a running non-interlocking fashion, the second imbricating over the first.  The patient's uterus was hemostatic.  Bladder flap was reapproximated with #0 Vicryl.  The patient then underwent an irrigation at every level of closure and the patient was quite hemostatic.  We reapproximated the rectus musculature with care being taken not to incorporate any underlying structures.  The patient had three interrupted sutures of this.  The fascia was reapproximated with two stitches of #0 Vicryl going from each apex towards the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  There was noted no fascial defects and the skin was closed with #0 Vicryl.,Prior to closing the abdominal cavity, the uterus appeared to be intact and bladder appeared to have clear urine and appeared to be intact.  The patient was hemostatic.  All counts were correct and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will see her back in recovery."

The patient has undergone cleft lip repair, and she is here today for her cleft palate operation.  We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits; the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, the need for future revision surgeries.  We will proceed with surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position, and general anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given.  The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X, from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery.  After he was done with his procedure, the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees.  The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut.  A Dingman retractor was placed.  The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, a total of 3 mL, and then, I proceeded with the prepping and draping.  The patient was prepped and draped.  I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The sponge, needle, and instrument count were completed at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition."

94,"PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6,OPERATION: , Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root.,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR.  After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.  The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  minimal."

Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction."
97,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time."
98,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cecal polyp.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cecal polyp.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic resection of cecal polyp.,COMPLICATIONS: , None., ,ANESTHESIA:  ,General oral endotracheal intubation.,PROCEDURE:,  After adequate general anesthesia was administered the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made.  Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps.  A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02.  Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant.  There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel.  The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve.  This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice.  The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal.  The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye.  There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp.  The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table.  The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear.  I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon.  This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined.  There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear.  The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution.  There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery.  The trocars were removed under direct vision.  No bleeding was noted.  The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
99,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 100 mL.,FINDINGS: , An 8-10 cm anteverted uterus, right ovary with a 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm simple cyst containing straw colored fluid, a normal-appearing left ovary, and normal-appearing tubes bilaterally.,SPECIMENS:  ,Uterine fragments.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained without difficulty.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia revealed an anteverted uterus and no adnexal masses.  The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed in the patient's bladder.  The patient's cervix was visualized with speculum.  A single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix.  A HUMI uterine manipulator was placed through the internal os of the cervix and the balloon was inflated.  The tenaculum and speculum were then removed from the vagina.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a small infraumbilical incision was made with scalpel.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the patient's abdomen was inflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  Veress needle was removed and then 5-mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision.  Laparoscope was placed through this incision and the patient's abdominal contents were visualized.  A 2nd trocar incision was placed in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis and a 5-mm trocar was placed through this incision on direct visualization for laparoscope.  A trocar incision was made in the right lower quadrant.  A 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  A ___ trocar incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a 2nd 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  The patient's abdominal and pelvic anatomy were again visualized with the assistance of a blunt probe.  The Gyrus cautery was used to cauterize and cut the right and left round ligaments.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was bluntly dissected and cauterized and cut in an inferior fashion towards lower uterine segment.  The right uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  The uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The Gyrus was then used to cauterize the right uterine vessels.  Gyrus was then used on the left side to cauterize and cut the left round ligament.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament on the left side was bluntly dissected, cauterized, and cut.  Using the Gyrus, the left uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut and the left uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The left uterine vessels were then cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  At this point, as the uterine vessels had been cauterized on both sides, the uterine body exhibited blanching.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel hook was used to amputate the uterine body from the cervix at the level just below the uterine vessels.  The HUMI manipulator was removed prior to amputation of the uterine body.  After the uterine body was detached from the cervical stump, morcellation of the uterine body was performed using the uterine morcellator.  The uterus was removed in a piecemeal fashion through the right lower quadrant trocar incision.  Once, all fragments of the uterus were removed from the abdominal cavity, the pelvis was irrigated.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to cauterize the remaining endocervical canal.  The cervical stump was also cauterized with the Harmonic scalpel and good hemostasis was noted at the cervical stump and also at the sites of all pedicles.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to incise the right ovarian simple cyst.  The right ovarian cyst was then drained yielding straw-colored fluid.  The site of right ovarian cystotomy was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ureters were identified on both sides and noted to be intact throughout the visualized course.  All instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was deflated.  The fascial defects at the 10-mm trocar sites were closed using figure-of-8 sutures of 0-Vicryl and skin incisions were closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  The cervix was then visualized with the speculum.  Good hemostasis at the site of tenaculum insertion was obtained using silver nitrate sticks.  All instruments were removed from the patient's vagina and the patient was placed in normal supine position.,Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
100,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,  Endoscopic carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA:,  I.V. sedation and local (1% Lidocaine).,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Zero.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
101,"She started her periods at age 13.  She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.,PAST MEDICAL HX:  ,Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.,PAST SURGICAL HX:  ,Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.,ALLERGIES:  ,NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HX: , She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.  She does have a boyfriend; again she states she is not sexually active.  She also states that she exercises regularly, does not smoke cigarettes, use drugs, or drink alcohol.,FAMILY HX: , Significant for her maternal grandfather with adult-onset diabetes, a maternal grandmother with hypertension, mother with depression, and a father who died of colon cancer at 32 years of age.  She also has a paternal great grandfather who was diagnosed with colon cancer.,PE: , VITALS: Height: 5 feet 5 inches.  Weight: 190 lb.  Blood Pressure: 120/88.  GENERAL: She is well-developed, well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Deferred.,A/P: , Abdominal pain, unclear etiology.  I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.  She will come back in six weeks for blood pressure check as well as in six months to followup on her pain and her bleeding patterns.,If she should have the recurrence of her pain, I have advised her to call."
102,"INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 22-year-old female with past medical history of syncope.  The patient is also complaining of dizziness.  She was referred here by Dr. X for tilt table.,TECHNIQUE: , Risks and benefits explained to the patient.  Consent obtained.  She was lying down on her back for 20 minutes and her blood pressure was 111/75 and heart rate 89.  She was standing up on the tilt tablet for 20 minutes and her heart rate went up to 127 and blood pressure was still in 120/80.  Then, the patient received sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg.  The patient felt dizzy at that time and heart rate was in the 120 and blood pressure was 110/50.  The patient felt nauseous and felt hot at that time.  She did not pass out.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Tilt table was then terminated.,SUMMARY:,  Positive tilt table for vasovagal syncope with significant increase of heart rate with minimal decrease of blood pressure.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I recommend followup in the office in one week and she will need Toprol-XL 12.5 mg every day if symptoms persist."
103,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise."

He awoke during the night with severe ear pain, and mom states that this is the third time this year he has had earaches.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Patient reports that he felt good after taking antibiotics with each earache episode and has recently started on the wrestling team.  Mom reports that patient has been afebrile with each of the earache episodes, and he has not had upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient denies any head trauma associated with wrestling practice.,BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:,  Patient's mother reports a normal pregnancy with no complications, having received prenatal care from 12 weeks.  Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.  The family goes out to eat once or twice a week and he only gets ""fast food"" once or twice a week according to his Mom.  He says he eats ""a lot"" especially after a wrestling meet.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,Height/weight:  Patient weighs 109 pounds (60th percentile) and is 69 inches tall (93rd percentile).  He is following the growth pattern he established in infancy.,Vital signs:  BP 110/60, T 99.2, HR 70, R 16.,General:  Alert, cooperative but a bit shy.,Neuro:  DTRs symmetric, 2+, negative Romberg, able to perform simple calculations without difficulty, short-term memory intact.  He responds appropriately to verbal and visual cues, and movements are smooth and coordinated.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, PEERLA, red reflex present, optic disk and ocular vessels normal.  TMs deep red, dull, landmarks obscured, full bilaterally.  Post auricular and submandibular nodes on left are palpable and slightly tender.,Lungs:  CTA, breath sounds equal bilaterally, excursion and chest configuration normal.,Cardiac:  S1, S2 split, no murmurs, pulses equal bilaterally.,Abdomen:  Soft, rounded, reports no epigastric tenderness but states that heartburn begins in epigastric area and rises to throat.  Bowel sounds active in all quadrants.  No hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.  No CVA tenderness.,Musculoskeletal:  Full range of motion, all extremities.  Spine straight, able to perform jumping jacks and duck walk without difficulty.,Genital:  Normal male, Tanner stage 4.  Rectal exam - small amount of soft stool, no fissures or masses.,LABS:  ,Stool negative for blood and H. pylori antigen.  Normal CBC and urinalysis.  A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled."

Placement of right external iliac artery catheter via left femoral approach.,2.  Arteriography of the right iliac arteries.,3.  Primary open angioplasty of the right iliac artery using an 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length angioplasty balloon.,3.  Open stent placement in the right external iliac artery for inadequate angiographic result of angioplasty alone.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with intravenous sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:,  He is a 67-year-old white male who is well known to me.  He had severe peripheral vascular disease and recently underwent a kidney transplant.  He has had some troubles with increasing serum creatinine and hypertension.  Duplex suggests a high-grade iliac stenosis just proximal to his transplant kidney.  He is brought to the operating room for arteriography and potential treatment of this.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operating room #14.  A condom catheter was put in place.  Preoperative antibiotics were administered.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made over his brachial artery after anesthetizing the skin.  His brachial artery was dissected free and looped with vessel loops.  Under direct vision, it was punctured with an 18-gauge needle and a short 3J guidewire and 6-French sheath put in place.  A 3J guidewire was then introduced after the administration of intravenous heparin and advanced into the descending thoracic aorta.  This was then advanced down into the right common iliac artery.  The catheter was placed over this and arteriography performed.  After adjusting the image intensifier to unfold the origin of the renal artery from the iliac system.  We were able to demonstrate an approximately 60-70% stenosis of the external iliac artery.  Immediately preceding the origin of the artery for the transplant kidney, which appeared to be widely patent.  We elected to try and treat this.  With catheter support a magic torque guidewire was advanced through the stenosis and into the common femoral artery.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length angioplasty balloon was positioned across the stenosis and inflated.  This inflation was held for one minute.  This was then deflated and a catheter positioned again in the proximal common iliac artery.  For this application, we used a guide catheter that would allow us to inject contrast without losing our wire purchase.  This showed an improvement in the stenosis, but a residual stenosis of at least 30% and we elected to stent this.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length stent was chosen and placed just proximal to the origin of the renal artery.  After this was completed, the stent introduction balloon was removed and the catheter replaced.  Repeat angiography showed a widely patent segment with no evidence of any residual stenosis.  There was no evidence of any dissection or damage to the renal artery.  We interpreted this as satisfactory procedure.  Guidewires and sheaths were removed.  The brachial artery was repaired with two interrupted sutures of 7-0 Prolene.  The wound was irrigated and the subcutaneous tissue closed with a running suture of Vicryl.  The skin was reapproximated with a running intracuticular suture of Monocryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile occlusive dressing were applied and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Estimated blood loss for the procedure was less than 50 mL.  Total contrast employed was 37.5 mL.  Total fluoroscopy time was 12 minutes and 43 seconds."

Review of chart indicates that mother has good adherence to treatment plan indicated by medications being refilled in a timely fashion as well as clinic contact documented with appropriate concerns.,DISCUSSION:  PHYSICIAN: , X did note that mother reported that the patient had discontinued the Pulmozyme due to CCS reasons.  He is not sure what this would be since CCS Pulmozyme is a covered benefit on CCS for children with cystic fibrosis.  This situation will be looked into with the hope of restarting soon.  Other than that the patient seems to be doing well.  A flu shot was given.,NURSE: , X, RN, BSN, did note that the patient was doing quite well.  Reinforcement of current medication regime was supplied.  No other needs identified at this time.,RESPIRATORY CARE: , X, RCP, did review appropriate sequencing of medications with the patient and family.  Once again, she was concerned the lack of Pulmozyme due to mom stating CCS issues.  At this time, they have increased the Vest use to twice daily and are doing 30-minute treatments.,DIETICIAN: , X, RD, CDE, notes that the patient is 89% of his ideal body weight, which is a nutritional failure per cystic fibrosis guidelines.  This is despite the fact that he has an excellent appetite.  Mom reports he is taking his enzymes consistently as well as vitamins.  He does have problems meeting his goal for resource drinks per day.  Since the patient has been struggling to gain weight this past year, we will need to monitor his nutritional status and weight trend very closely.  A variety of additional high calorie items were discussed with mom.,SOCIAL WORK: , X, LCSW, notes that mom has recently gradually from respiratory therapy school and has accepted a position here at Children's Hospital.  The patient is doing well in school.  With the exception of issues with CCS authorization, there appears to be no pressing social needs at this time.,IMPRESSION: , ,1.  Cystic fibrosis.,2.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office."

Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,1.  External fixation of left pilon fracture.,2.  Closed reduction of left great toe, T1 fracture.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 10 mL.,Needle, instrument, and sponge counts were done and correct.,DRAINS AND TUBES: , None.,SPECIMENS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 58-year-old female who was involved in an auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009.  The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture."
111,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist."

113,"PROCEDURE:,1.  Implantation, dual chamber ICD.,2.  Fluoroscopy.,3.  Defibrillation threshold testing.,4.  Venography.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was attempted to be punctured but unsuccessfully.  Approximately 10 cc of intravenous contrast was injected into the left upper extremity peripheral vein.  Venogram was then performed.  Under fluoroscopy via modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was punctured and a guidewire was passed through the vein into the superior vena cava, then the right atrium and then into the inferior vena cava.  A second guidewire was placed in a similar fashion.  Approximately a 5 cm incision was made in the left upper anterior chest.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected out of the prepectoral fascia.  Both guide wires were brought into the pocket area.  A sheath was placed over the lateral guidewire and fluoroscopically guided to the vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  A Fixation ventricular lead, under fluoroscopic guidance, was placed through the sheath into the superior vena cava, right atrium and then right ventricle.  Using straight and curved stylettes, it was placed in position and screwed into the right ventricular apex.  After pacing and sensing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  A guide sheath was placed over the guidewire and fluoroscopically placed in the superior vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  An Active Fixation atrial lead was fluoroscopically passed through the sheath, into the superior vena cava and then the right atrium.  Using straight and J-shaped stylettes, it was placed in the appropriate position and screwed in the right atrial appendage area.  After significant pacing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscles with Ethibond suture.  The tract was flushed with saline solution.  A Medtronic pulse generator was attached to both the leads and fixed to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  Deep and superficial layers were closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Steri-strips were placed over the incision.  Tegaderm was placed over the Steri-strips.  Pressure dressing was applied to the pocket area."

There was no bleeding at the circumcision site.,PROCEDURE:,  Patient was placed on the circumcision restraint board.  EMLA had been applied approximately 90 minutes before.  A time-out was completed satisfactorily per protocol.  The area was prepped with Betadine.  The foreskin was grasped with sterile clamps and was dissected away from the corona and the glans penis with blunt dissection.  A Mogen clamp was applied to the cervix.  The excess foreskin was excised with the scalpel.  The clamp was removed.  At this point, the procedure was terminated.  Sterile Vaseline and gauze was applied to the glans penis.  There were no complications.  There was minimal blood loss."
115,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left atrophic mandibular fracture, removal of failed dental implant from the left mandible.,ANESTHESIA: , General nasotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 125 mL.,FLUIDS GIVEN: , 1 L of crystalloids.,SPECIMEN: , Soft tissue from the fracture site sent for histologic diagnosis.,CULTURES: , Also sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic, culture and sensitivity.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 79-year-old male, who fell in his hometown, following an episode of syncope.  He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL."

An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.

After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table.  Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was carried out from L4 to S1.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization.  A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum.  At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1.  Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space.  At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar.  The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk.  We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root.  Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic.

The patient states she has extreme pain with plantar fascitis in her left foot and has attempted conservative treatment including orthotics without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.  The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.  The patient is given postoperative pain prescriptions for Vicodin ES, one q3-4h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg one p.o. b.i.d.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X as directed."

Debulking of hemangioma of the nasal tip through an open rhinoplasty approach.,2.  Rhinoplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,FINDINGS: , Large hemangioma involving the midline of the columella separated the lower lateral cartilages at a level of the columella and the nasal domes.,CONDITION:  ,Condition of the patient at end of the procedure stable, transferred to recovery room.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 2-year-old female with a history of a nasal tip hemangioma.  The hemangioma has involved at her upper tongue.  There has not been any change in the last 6 months.  We have discussed with the parents the situation and decided to proceed with the debulking of the nasal tip hemangioma.  They understand the nature of the incision, the nature of the surgery, and the possibility of future revision surgeries.  They understand the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery, and minor asymmetry.  They wished to proceed with surgery.,Because of the procedure, informed consent is obtained.  The patient is taken to operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic is administrated to an oroendotracheal tube.  The face is prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The incision is designed to the lower aspect of the hemangioma, which corresponds to the columella and upper lip junction and then the remaining of the incision is designed as an open rhinoplasty with bilateral rim incisions.  The area is infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine.  We waited 7 minutes for the hemostatic effect and proceeded with the incision.  The incision was then done with a 15 C blade starting at the columella and then going laterally to the level of the rim and the double hook is placed at the level of the dome and the intracartilage incision is done through the mucosa, then extended laterally and upward to follow the lower lateral cartilage.  This is done in both sides.  Further incision is done.  A small tenotomy scissors is used and with the help of retraction of the lower lateral cartilage, the hemangioma is separated gently from the lower lateral cartilage on both sides and I proceeded to leave that the central part of the incision lifting up the entire columella to the level of the nasal tip.  The hemangioma is removed and is found to be involving the medial aspects of both medial crura.  This gently separated from the medial crura and from the soft tissue care is taken not to remove the entire hemangioma from the skin as the nose not to devascularize the distal columella portion.  Hemostasis is achieved with electrocautery.  Then, we proceed to place some interdomal stitches with the help of a 6-0 clear nylon and intercrural stitches are placed and then an interdomal stitch, a single one was placed.  The skin is redraped and the nose found to have satisfactory shape.  The columellar piece was tailored on the lateral aspect corresponding to rim incisions to match the newly created width of the columella.  Portions of skin and hemangioma are taken laterally on both sides of the columella distally.  The skin was closed with 6-0 mild chromic stitches, including the portion at the level of the columella and rim incisions medially.  The remaining of the internal incisions are closed with 5-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The nose is irrigated and suctioned.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge and instrument count were complete at the end of the procedure."

Status post mitral valve repair.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Mediastinal exploration with repair of right atrium.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , The patient had undergone mitral valve repair about seven days ago.  He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside.  Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic.  He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires.  He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia.  Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision.  Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted.  There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity.  Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest.  Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation.  This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures.  An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis.  No other sites of bleeding were identified.  The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution.  Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube.  The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures.  The skin was then closed with a running subcuticular stitch.  The patient was then taken to the Intensive Care Unit in a critical but stable condition."

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.,Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.,The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition."

There were bowel adhesions noted through the anterior abdominal wall.  The uterus was noted to be within normal limits.  The tubes and ovaries bilaterally were noted to be within normal limits.  The baby was delivered from the right sacral anterior position without any difficulty.  Apgars 8 and 9.  Weight was 7.5 lb.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old G3 P 2-0-0-2 with reported 30 and 4/7th weeks' for a scheduled cesarean section secondary to repeat x2.  She had her first C-section because of congenial hip problems.  In her second C-section, baby was breached, therefore, she is scheduled for a third C-section.  The patient also requests sterilization.  Therefore, she requested a tubal ligation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.  The fascia was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous layer and Scarpa's fascia were repaired with a #3-0 Vicryl.  Then, the skin edges were reapproximated using sterile clips.  The dressing was placed.  The uterus was then cleared of all clots and debris manually.  Then, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle, counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to recovery in sable condition.  She will be followed up throughout her hospital stay."

132,"OPERATION,1.  Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy.,2.  Feeding jejunostomy.,3.  Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.,4.  Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition."

No evidence of tumor was found.,BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 54-year-old female who was complaining of right hand numbness and tingling of the median distribution and has elected to undergo carpal tunnel surgery secondary to failure of conservative management.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative room and placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity.  The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free.  Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand.  We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel.,Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves.  Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel.  We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament.  We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel.  We then irrigated copiously.  Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held.  There was no evidence of obvious bleeders.  We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU."

136,"NAME OF PROCEDURES,1.  Selective coronary angiography.,2.  Left heart catheterization.,3.  Left ventriculography.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The area of the right coronary artery was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Conscious sedation was obtained using a combination of Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  A left #4, 4-French, Judkins catheter was placed and advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery.  Because of difficulty positioning the catheter, the catheter was removed and a 6-French sheath was placed and a 6-French #4 left Judkins catheter was placed.  This was advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  Following this, the 4-French right Judkins catheter was placed and angiograms of the right coronary were performed.  A pigtail catheter was placed and a left heart catheterization was performed, followed by a left ventriculogram.  The left heart pullback was performed.  The catheter was removed and a small injection of contrast was given to the sheath.  The sheath was removed over a wire and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There were no complications.  Total contrast media was 200 mL of Optiray 350.  Fluoroscopy time 5.3 minutes.  Total x-ray dose is 1783 mGy.,HEMODYNAMICS:  ,Rhythm is sinus throughout the procedure.  LV pressure of 155/22 mmHg, aortic pressure of 160/80 mmHg.  LV pullback demonstrates no gradient.,The right coronary artery is a nondominant vessel and free of disease.  This also gives rise to the conus branch and two RV free wall branches.  The left main has minor plaquing in the inferior aspect measuring no more than 10% to 15%.  This vessel then bifurcates into the LAD and circumflex.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel and is dominant.  This vessel gives rise to a large first marginal artery, a moderate sized second marginal branch, and additionally gives rise to a large third marginal artery and the PDA.  There was a very eccentric and severe stenosis in the proximal circumflex measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The origin of the first marginal artery has a severe stenosis measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The distal circumflex has a 60% lesion just prior to the origin of the third marginal branch and PDA.,The proximal LAD is ectatic.  The LAD gives rise to a large first diagonal artery that has a 90% lesion in its origin and a subtotal occlusion midway down the diagonal.  Distal to the origin of this diagonal branch, there is another area of ectasia in the LAD, followed by an area of stenosis that in some views is approximately 50% in severity.,The left ventriculogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.  The overall ejection fraction is preserved.  There is moderate dilatation of the aortic root.  The calculated ejection fraction is 63%.,IMPRESSION,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced by increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall.,2.

Left hip arthroscopic femoral neck osteoplasty.,3.  Left hip arthroscopic labral repair.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general anesthetic.  His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure very well with no signs of complications."

145,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

The sheath was washed with sterile saline.  Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed.  A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD.  The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro.  The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures.  The balloon was deflated and angiography demonstrated establishment of flow.  Following this, the lesion was stented with a 2.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent at 10 atmospheres.

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition."

Status post-respiratory arrest.,2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,3. Congestive heart failure.,4. History of coronary artery disease.,5. History of hypertension.,SUMMARY:,  The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.,NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.,HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.,PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.,EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA:,  The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:,  His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o. twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d., nitroglycerin paste 1 inch h.s., K-Dur 60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.

Arrangements have been made for the patient to have an echocardiogram for further evaluation of his congestive heart failure later on the day of discharge."
151,"HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old, who has a history of Shone complex and has a complete heart block.  He is on the pacemaker.  He had a coarctation of the aorta and that was repaired when he was an infant.  He was followed in our Cardiology Clinic here and has been doing well.  However last night, he was sleeping, and he states he felt as if he has having a dream, and there was thunder in this dream, which woke him up.  He then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal.  Thus, his dad put him in the car and transported him here.  He has been evaluated here.  He had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced.  It was 2 a.m. when he woke, and again, he was brought here by private vehicle.  He was well prior to going to bed.  No cough, cold, runny nose, fever.  No trauma has been noted.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Shone complex, pacemaker dependent.,MEDICATIONS: , He is on no medications at this time.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no allergies.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up to date.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives with his parents.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,REVIEW OF SYSTEM: , Twelve asked, all negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an awake, alert male, who appears to be in mild distress.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  His TMs are clear.  His nares are clear.  The mucous membranes are pink and moist.  Throat is clear.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Shows bradycardia at 53.  He has good distal pulses.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.  No rashes are seen.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Initial blood pressure is 164/90.  He was moved in room 1.  He was placed on nasal cannula.  Pulse ox was 100%, which is normal.  We placed him on a monitor.  We did an EKG; it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time.  Shortly after the patient's arrival, the Medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker.  Medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures, oversensing, and automatic defibrillation.  As noted, he was transferred to room 1, placed on a monitor, pulse ox.  An IV was placed.  A standard blood work was sent.  A chest x-ray was done showing normal heart size, lead appeared to be in placed.  There was no evidence of pulmonary edema.  His pacemaker did not appear to be capturing.  We placed him on transthoracic leads.  However, it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed.  The Medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.  However, we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart.  When the Medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker, the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s.  The patient appeared to be in pain.  We placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time.  He has remained in sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ectopic beats.  No widening of his QRS complex.  I spoke with Cardiology.  Cardiology service has come in, has evaluated him at bedside with me.  Again, we turned up the transthoracic pacer, but it is again not seem to be picking up, and his heart rate is still going with the Medtronic's internal pacemaker.  So with the ICU physician on call, Dr. X, he has agreed with taking this young man to the ICU.,An hour after presentation here, the ICU was ready for bed.  I accompanied the patient up to the ICU.  He remained awake and alert.  Initially, he was complaining of a lot of chest pain.  Once the defibrillator was turned off, he had no more pain.  He was transported to the Pediatrics PICU and delivered in stable condition.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC was normal.  Chem-20 was normal as well.,IMPRESSION:  ,Complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction.,PLAN:  ,He is admitted to the ICU.,TIME SEEN: , Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.  I should note that a 12-lead EKG was done here showing sinus bradycardia, normal intervals otherwise."

153,"The patient presented in the early morning hours of February 12, 2007, with contractions.  The patient was found to be in false versus early labor and managed as an outpatient.  The patient returned to labor and delivery approximately 12 hours later with regular painful contractions.  There was minimal cervical dilation, but 80% effacement by nurse examination.  The patient was admitted.  Expected management was utilized initially.  Stadol was used for analgesia.  Examination did not reveal vulvar lesions.  Epidural was administered.  Membranes ruptured spontaneously.  Cervical dilation progressed.  Acceleration-deceleration complexes were seen.  Overall, fetal heart tones remained reassuring during the progress of labor.  The patient was allowed to ""labor down"" during second stage.  Early decelerations were seen as well as acceleration-deceleration complexes.  Overall, fetal heart tones were reassuring.  Good maternal pushing effort produced progressive descent.,Spontaneous controlled sterile vaginal delivery was performed without episiotomy and accomplished without difficulty.  Fetal arm was wrapped at the level of the neck with the fetal hand and also at the level of the neck.  There was no loop or coil of cord.  Infant was vigorous female sex.  Oropharynx was aggressively aspirated.  Cord blood was obtained.  Placenta delivered spontaneously.,Following delivery, uterus was explored without findings of significant tissue.  Examination of the cervix did not reveal lacerations.  Upper vaginal lacerations were not seen.  Multiple first-degree lacerations were present.  Specific locations included the vestibula at 5 o'clock, left labia minora with short extension up the left sulcus, right anterior labia minora at the vestibule, and midline of the vestibule.  All mucosal lacerations were reapproximated with interrupted simple sutures of 4-0 Vicryl with the knots being buried.  Post-approximation examination of the rectum showed smooth, intact mucosa.

Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver.,HISTORY: ,The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition."

Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress."
160,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right undescended testicle.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right undescended testicle.,OPERATIONS:,1.  Right orchiopexy.,2.  Right herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Sac.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis.  The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions."

He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded."

Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."

165,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right hallux abductovalgus deformity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right hallux abductovalgus deformity.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Right McBride bunionectomy.,2.  Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with IV sedation.,HEMOSTASIS: , With pneumatic ankle cuff.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.  The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.,The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided.  The patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no weightbearing on the surgical foot.,"

Arrest of dilation.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Primary low-transverse cesarean section.,ANESTHESIA: , Epidural.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 1000 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS:  ,Female infant in cephalic presentation, OP position, weight 9 pounds 8 ounces.  Apgars were 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  Normal uterus, tubes, and ovaries were noted.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 20-year-old gravida 1, para 0 female, who presented to labor and delivery in early active labor at 40 and 6/7 weeks gestation.  The patient progressed to 8 cm, at which time, Pitocin was started.  She subsequently progressed to 9 cm, but despite adequate contractions, arrested dilation at 9 cm.  A decision was made to proceed with a primary low transverse cesarean section.,The procedure was described to the patient in detail including possible risks of bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs, and possible need for further surgery.  Informed consent was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where epidural anesthesia was found to be adequate.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position with a left-ward tilt.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to elevate the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.,The peritoneum was bluntly dissected, entered, and extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified with pickups and entered sharply using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was reinserted.  The lower uterine segment was incised in a transverse fashion using the scalpel and extended using manual traction.  Clear fluid was noted.  The infant was subsequently delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was subsequently handed to the awaiting nursery nurse.  Next, cord blood was obtained per the patient's request for cord blood donation, which took several minutes to perform.  Subsequent to the collection of this blood, the placenta was removed spontaneously intact with a 3-vessel cord noted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was repaired in 2 layers using 0 chromic suture.  Hemostasis was visualized.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.,The pelvis was copiously irrigated.  The uterine incision was reexamined and was noted to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscles were reapproximated in the midline using 3-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous layer was closed with 3-0 plain gut, and the skin was closed with staples.  Sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was stable at the completion of the procedure and was subsequently transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
167,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Ectopic left testis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Ectopic left testis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left orchiopexy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.  The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient was cleansed.,The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum.  He will follow up with Dr. X in 10 to 14 days.  Appointment will be made."
168,"HISTORY: , The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass.  The patient has been earlier seen by Dr. X, her physician.  She has been referred to us from Family Practice.  In short, she is a 33-year-old lady with a BMI of 43, otherwise healthy with unsuccessful nonsurgical methods of weight loss. ,She was on laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight loss. ,She meets the National Institute of Health Criteria.  She is very well educated and motivated and has no major medical contraindications for the procedure.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination today, she weighs 216 pounds with a BMI of 43.5, pulse is 96, temperature is 97.6, blood pressure is 122/80.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  There is stigmata for morbid obesity.  She has cesarean section scars in the lower abdomen with no herniation. ,DISCUSSION: , I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass, possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to her complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak , peritonitis, sepsis, shock, multisystem organ failure, need for re-operation including for leak or bleeding, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, rare case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, etc., with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis in the postoperative period were also discussed. ,Short-term complications of gastric bypass including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or anti-inflammatory drug intake which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which were discussed.  The patient would alert us for earlier intervention.  Symptomatic gallstone formation secondary to rapid weight loss were also discussed.  How to avoid it by taking ursodiol were also discussed.  Long-term complications of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, need for major lifestyle and exercise and habit changes, avoiding pregnancy in the first two years, etc., were all stressed.  The patient understands.  She wants to go to surgery. ,In preparation of surgery, she will undergo very low-calorie diet through Medifast to decrease the size of the liver to make laparoscopic approach more successful and also to optimize her cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  She will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary effort for short and long-term success for weight loss surgery.  I will see her two weeks before the plan of surgery for further discussion and any other questions at that point of time."

171,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pyogenic granuloma, left lateral thigh.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pyogenic granuloma, left lateral thigh.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE: , Excision of recurrent pyogenic granuloma.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is 12-year-old young lady, who has a hand-sized congenital vascular malformation on her left lateral thigh below the greater trochanter, which was described by her parents as a birthmark.  This congenital cutaneous vascular malformation faded substantially over the first years of her life and has regressed to a flat, slightly hyperpigmented lesion.  Although no isolated injury event can be recalled, the patient has developed a pyogenic granuloma next to the distal portion of this lesion on her mid thigh, and it has been treated with topical cautery in her primary care doctor's office, but with recurrence.  She is here today for excision.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had what appeared to be a classic pyogenic granuloma arising from this involuted vascular malformation.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room, had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out, reiterated her important and unique identifying information and confirmed that the excision of the left thigh pyogenic granuloma was the procedure planned for today.  Preparation and draping was __________ ensued with a chlorhexidine based prep solution.  The pyogenic granuloma was approximately 6 to 7 mm in greatest dimension and to remove it required creating an elliptical incision of about 1 to 1.2 cm.  This entire area was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine to provide a wide local field block and then an elliptical incision was made with a #15 scalpel blade, excising the pyogenic granuloma, its base, and a small rim of surrounding normal skin.  Some of the abnormal vessels in the dermal and subdermal layer were cauterized with the needle-tip electrocautery pencil.  The wound was closed in layers with a deep dermal roll of 5-0 Monocryl stitches supplemented by 5-0 intradermal Monocryl and Steri-Strips for final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  This nodule was submitted to pathology for confirmation of its histology as a pyogenic granuloma.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL and there were no complications."

Adenoidectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS: , The patient was brought to the operating room, endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. Both sides of the patient's nose were then sprayed with Afrin.  Ears were inspected then with the operating microscope.  The anterior inferior quadrant myringotomy incisions were performed.  Then, a modest amount of serous and a trace of mucoid material encountered that was evacuated.  The middle ear mucosa looked remarkably clean.  Armstrong tubes were inserted.  Ciprodex drops were instilled.  Ciprodex will be planned for two postoperative days as well.  Nasal endoscopy was carried out, and evidence of acute purulent adenoiditis was evident in spite of the fact that clinically the patient has shown some modest improvement following cessation of all milk products.  The adenoids were shaved back, flushed with curette through a traditional transoral route with thick purulent material emanating from the crypts, and representative cultures were taken.  Additional adenoid tissue was shaved backwards with the RADenoid shaver.  Electrocautery was used to establish hemostasis, and repeat nasal endoscopy accomplished.  The patient still had residual evidence of inter choanal adenoid tissue, and video photos were taken.  That remaining material was resected, guided by the nasal endoscope using the RADenoid shaver to remove the material and flush with the posterior nasopharynx.  Electrocautery again used to establish hemostasis.  Bleeding was trivial.  Extensive irrigation accomplished.  No additional bleeding was evident.  The patient was awakened, extubated, taken to the recovery room in a stable condition.  Discharge anticipated later in the day on Augmentin 400 mg twice daily, Lortab or Tylenol p.r.n. for pain.  Office recheck would be anticipated if stable and doing well in approximately two weeks.

She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving.  She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home.  She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren.  She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression.  There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home.  She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister.  She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren.  She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations.  She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it.  When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot.  She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication.  She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly.  She denies visual or migraine symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia.  She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus.  Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness.  She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago.

The mesothelioma is in her abdomen.  She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma.  She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma.  Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable.  She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position.  These have all occurred over the past five years.  She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation.  This diagnosis was given in March 2006.,MEDICATIONS:,  Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.,ALLERGIES:, NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for her being without a companion at this point.

She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz.  He has grandchildren.  She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer.  Her mother died in her 80s of ""old age,"" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time.  Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient.  No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg.  She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress.  She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date.  She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in.  She lost three points for recall.  Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember.  Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30.  There were no naming problems or problems with repetition.  There were also no signs of dysarthria.  Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular movements were intact.  Her visual fields were full to confrontation.  Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal.  There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation.  Tongue was midline.  Her palate was symmetric.  Her face was symmetric as well.  Strength was approximately 5/5.  She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain.  Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace.  Her plantar reflexes were mute.  Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration.  There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia.  Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.,SUMMARY:,  Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.  We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured.  We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.  She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept.  The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV.  It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.  She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept.  She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day.  We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.,"
175,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:  ,Thoracentesis, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the recovery area of the operating room.  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,"
176,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Total left knee replacement on 08/19/03.  The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 76 minutes.,BLOOD LOSS: , 150 cc.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE:,  NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component.  The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient."
177,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.,On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.,She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.,Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.,Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.,MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,SKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.,LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.,LUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.  Dressings are clean and dry.,EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.  Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.,LABORATORY DATA:,  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow."

Transferred to the recovery room.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 4-year-old with a history of sebaceous cyst.  The patient is undergoing PE tubes by Dr. X and I was asked to remove the cyst on the right lateral eyebrow.  I saw the patient in my clinic.  I explained to the mother in Spanish the risk and benefits.  Risk included but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery.  We will proceed with the surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  The patient was prepped and draped in a usual manner.  The procedure began by infiltrating lidocaine with epinephrine around the cyst area.  Then, I proceeded with the help of a 15C blade to make an incision and remove a small wedge of tissue that includes a comedo point.  The incision was done superiorly then inferiorly to a full thickness and to the skin down to the cyst.  The cyst was detached of the surrounding structure with the help of blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The wound was closed with 5-0 Vicryl deep dermal interrupted stitches and Dermabond.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were completed at the end of the procedure."
179,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right superior parathyroid adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right superior parathyroid adenoma.,PROCEDURE: , Excision of right superior parathyroid adenoma.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local with 1% Xylocaine and anesthesia standby with sedation.,CLINICAL HISTORY:,  This 80-year-old woman has had some mild dementia.  She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision.""  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."

184,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina.  In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her.  I advised her to call 911, which she did.  While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , The patient has been having arm pain for several months.  She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  The decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel.  She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  This is her usual angina.  She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.

No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI nondisplaced.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.,EXTREMITIES:  Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses grossly intact.  Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses.,LABORATORY DATA: , EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease.,Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.  BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9.  Glucose 110.  Magnesium 2.5.  ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08.  INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc.  I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion.  I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function.  She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  The patient desires full resuscitation status."

All components were cemented with Cobalt G.,ANESTHESIA:,  Spinal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , Less than 60 minutes.,The patient was taken to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 51-year-old female complaining of worsening right knee pain.  The patient had failed conservative measures and having difficulties with her activities of daily living as well as recurrent knee pain and swelling.  The patient requested surgical intervention and need for total knee replacement.,All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of surgery were explained to her in great detail and she signed informed consent.  All risks including nerve and vessel damage, infection, and revision of surgery as well as component failure were explained to the patient and she did sign informed consent.  The patient was given antibiotics preoperatively.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating suite and placed in supine position on the operating table.  She was placed in the seated position and a spinal anesthetic was placed, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was then moved to supine position again and a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the right thigh.  Right lower extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All extremities were padded prior to this.,The right lower extremity, after being prepped and draped in the sterile fashion, the tourniquet was elevated and maintained for less than 60 minutes in this case.  A midline incision was made over the right knee and medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  Patella was everted.  The infrapatellar fat pad was incised and medial and lateral meniscectomy was performed and the anterior cruciate ligament was removed.  The posterior cruciate ligament was intact.,There was severe osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment on the lateral femoral condyle as well as mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial femoral compartment as well severe osteoarthritis along the patellofemoral compartment.  The medial periosteal tissue on the proximal tibia was elevated to the medial collateral ligament and medial collateral ligament was left intact throughout the entirety of the case.,At the extramedullary tibial guide, an extended cut was made adjusting for her alignment.  Once this was performed, excess bone was removed.  The reamer was placed along on the femoral canal, after which a 6-degree valgus distal cut was made along the distal femur.  Once this was performed, the distal femoral size in 3 degrees external rotation, 62.5-mm cutting block was placed in 3 degrees external rotation with anterior and posterior cuts as well as anterior and posterior Chamfer cuts remained in the standard fashion.  Excess bone was removed.,Next, the tibia was brought anterior and excised to 71 mm.  It was then punched in standard fashion adjusting for appropriate rotation along the alignment of the tibia.  Once this was performed, a 71-mm tibial trial was placed as well as a 62.5-mm femoral trial was placed with a 12-mm polyethylene insert.,Next, the patella was cut in the standard fashion measuring 31 mm and a patella bed was placed.  The knee was taken for range of motion; had excellent flexion and extension as well as adequate varus and valgus stability.  There was no loosening appreciated.  There is no laxity appreciated along the posterior cruciate ligament.,Once this was performed, the trial components were removed.  The knee was irrigated with fluid and antibiotics, after which the cement was put on the back table, this being Cobalt G, it was placed on the tibia.  The tibial components were tagged in position and placed on the femur.  The femoral components were tagged into position.  All excess cement was removed ___ placement of patella.  It was tagged in position.  A 12-mm polyethylene insert was placed; knee was held in extension and all excess cement was removed.  The cement hardened with the knee in full extension, after which any extra cement was removed.,The wounds were copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics, and medial parapatellar arthrotomy was closed with #2 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous tissue was approximated with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the gurney, and taken into postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."
186,"OPERATIONS,1.  Mitral valve repair using a quadrangular resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet.,2.  Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition."

188,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: , Fever of unknown origin.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.,In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.,A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.,On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.,Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.,2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone).,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.

She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.  Consent was obtained for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4 cm incision was created in the midline above the xiphoid.  Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.,This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Chest tubes were placed on 20 cm of water suction.  The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition."

Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography.,2.  Selective coronary angiography.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in fasting state.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used as local anesthetic.  Versed and fentanyl were used for conscious sedation.  Next, a #6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Next, selective angiography of the left coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French JL4 catheter.  Next, selective angiography of the right coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French 3DRC catheter.  Next, a #6-French angle pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle.  The left ventricular pressure was then recorded.  Left ventriculography was the performed using 36 mL of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  The left heart pull back was then performed.  The catheter was then removed.,Angiography of the right femoral artery was performed.  Hemostasis was obtained by Angio-Seal closure device.  The patient left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.,HEMODYNAMICS,1.  LV pressure was 163/0 with end-diastolic pressure of 17.  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Left ventriculography showed old inferior wall hypokinesis.  Global left ventricular systolic function is normal.  Estimated ejection fraction was 58%.  There is no significant mitral regurgitation.,3.  Significant coronary artery disease.,4.  The left main is approximately 7 or 8 mm proximally.  It trifurcates into left anterior descending artery, ramus intermedius artery, and left circumflex artery.  The distal portion of the left main has an ulcerated excentric plaque, up to about 50% in severity.,5.  The left anterior descending artery is around 4 mm proximally.  It extends slightly beyond the apex into the inferior wall.  It gives rises to several medium size diagonal branches as well as small to medium size multiple septal perforators.  At the ostium of the left anterior descending artery, there was an eccentric plaque up to 70% to 80%, best seen in the shallow LAO with caudal angulation.,There was no other flow-limiting disease noted in the rest of the left anterior descending artery or its major branches.,The ramus intermedius artery is around 3 mm proximally, but shortly after its origin, it bifurcates into two medium size branches.  There was no significant disease noted in the ramus intermedius artery however.,The left circumflex artery is around 2.5 mm proximally.  It gave off a recurrent atrial branch and a small AV groove branch prior to terminating into a bifurcating medium size obtuse marginal branch.  The mid to distal circumflex has a moderate disease, which is relatively diffuse up to about 40% to 50%.,The right coronary artery is around 4 mm in diameter.  It gives off conus branch, two medium size acute marginal branches, relatively large posterior descending artery and a posterior lateral branch.  In the mid portion of the right coronary artery at the origin of the first acute marginal branch, there is a relatively discrete stenosis of about 80% to 90%.  Proximally, there is an area of eccentric plaque, but seem to be non-flow limiting, at best around 20% to 30%.  Additionally, there is what appears to be like a shell-like lesion in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery as well.  The posterior descending artery has an eccentric plaque of about 40% to 50% in its mid segment.,PLAN:  ,Plan to consult cardiovascular surgery for consideration of coronary artery bypass surgery.

197,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities."

He was found to have full extension after release of A1 pulley.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is 2-1/2-year-old.  He has a history of a trigger thumb.  This was evaluated in the office.  He was indicated for release of A1 pulley to allow for full excursion.  Risks and benefits including recurrence, infection, and problems with anesthesia were discussed at length with the family.  They wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought into the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard fashion.  Limb was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Tourniquet was raised to 200 torr.  Transverse incision was then made at the base of thumb.  The underlying soft tissues were carefully spread in line longitudinally.  The underlying tendon was then identified.  The accompanied A1 pulley was also identified.  This was incised longitudinally using #11 blade.  Inspection of the entire tendon then demonstrated good motion both in flexion and extension.  The leaflets of the pulley were easily identified.,The wound was then irrigated and closed.  The skin was closed using interrupted #4-0 Monocryl simple sutures.  The area was injected with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  The wound was dressed with Xeroform, dry sterile dressings, hand dressing, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no complications.  All instrument, sponge, needle counts were correct at the end of case.,PLAN: , The patient will be discharged home.  He will return in 1-1/2 weeks for wound inspection."
199,"TITLE OF PROCEDURE: , Insertion of Port-A-Cath via left subclavian vein using fluoroscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  This is a 49-year-old gentleman was referred by Dr. A.  The patient underwent a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in 1999 in Philadelphia.  He has developed recurrence with metastases to the lung and to bone.,The patient is on dialysis via a right internal jugular PermCath that was placed elsewhere.,In the operating room under monitored anesthesia care with intravenous sedation, the patient was prepped and draped suitably.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was used for local anesthesia and the left subclavian vein was punctured at the first pass without difficulty.  A J-wire was guided into place under fluoroscopic control.  A 7.2-French vortex titanium Port-A-Cath was now anchored in the subcutaneous pocket made just below using 3-0 Prolene.  The attached catheter tunneled, cut to the appropriate length and placed through the sheath that was then peeled away.  Fluoroscopy showed good catheter disposition in the superior vena cava.  The catheter was accessed with a butterfly Huber needle, blood was aspirated easily and the system was then flushed using heparinized saline.  The pocket was irrigated using antibiotic saline and closed with absorbable suture.  The port was left accessed with the butterfly needle after dressings were applied and the patient is to report to Dr. A's office later today for the commencement of chemotherapy.  There were no complications."
200,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.,X-RAY INTERPRETATION:,  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.,2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.,PLAN/TREATMENT:,1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.,2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.,3.  All questions were answered."
201,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4.,GRAFTS PERFORMED: , LIMA to LAD, left radial artery from the aorta to the PDA, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips."
202,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Malnutrition and dysphagia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Malnutrition and dysphagia with two antral polyps and large hiatal hernia.,PROCEDURES: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of one of the polyps and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation, 1% Xylocaine locally.,CONDITION:,  Stable.,OPERATIVE NOTE IN DETAIL: , After risk of operation was explained to this patient's family, consent was obtained for surgery.  The patient was brought to the GI lab.  There, she was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position.  She was given IV sedation by Anesthesia.  Her abdomen was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine.  Flexible gastroscope was passed down the esophagus, through the stomach into the duodenum.  No lesions were noted in the duodenum.  There appeared to be a few polyps in the antral area, two in the antrum.  Actually, one appeared to be almost covering the pylorus.  The scope was withdrawn back into the antrum.  On retroflexion, we could see a large hiatal hernia.  No other lesions were noted.  Biopsy was taken of one of the polyps.  The scope was left in position.  Anterior abdominal wall was prepped with Betadine, 1% Xylocaine was injected in the left epigastric area.  A small stab incision was made and a large bore Angiocath was placed directly into the anterior abdominal wall, into the stomach, followed by a thread, was grasped with a snare using the gastroscope, brought out through the patient's mouth.  Tied to the gastrostomy tube, which was then pulled down and up through the anterior abdominal wall.  It was held in position with a dressing and a stent.  A connector was applied to the cut gastrostomy tube, held in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was returned to the floor in stable condition."
203,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION:,  Muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.,Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, GERD, and headaches.,MEDICATIONS: , Trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, Prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.  He does not smoke.  He lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids.  He previously was a security guard, but is currently on disability.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 150/80, pulse of 80, respiratory rate 22, and weight 360 pounds.  Pain scale 7/10.  A full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart.,The patient is obese with significant ankle edema.,Neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination.  Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip.  Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  Tone and bulk are normal.  Sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  He has no vibration sense at his knees.  Similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  The only reflexes I could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  Remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  No Babinski.  The patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  He has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  Positive Romberg with eyes open and closed.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,1.  Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  He has relative preservation of motor function.  Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.,2.  He has history of myoclonic jerks.  I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy., ,I have recommended the following:,1.  EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.,2.  Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.,3.  Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,4.

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition."

The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS."

Severe mucosal irregularity with endobronchial narrowing of the right middle and lower lobes.,6.  Left vocal cord irregularity.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy with lavage, brushings, and endobronchial mucosal biopsies of the right bronchus intermedius/right lower lobe.,ANESTHESIA: , Demerol 50 mg with Versed 3 mg as well as topical cocaine and lidocaine solution.,LOCATION OF PROCEDURE: , Endoscopy suite #4.,After informed consent was obtained and following the review of the procedure including procedure as well as possible risks and complications were explained and consent was previously obtained, the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and EKG monitoring.  Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.,The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.  The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.,The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline.  The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers.  The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was placed on the wound.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

She was seen and evaluated.  On routine mammography, revealed a density in the left breast approximately at 4 o'clock position several centimeters lateral to the nipple complex.  She was readmitted for excisional biopsy.,Due to the nonpalpable nature of this lesion, the patient underwent first needle localization of the breast at the  Hospital and was taken to the operating room.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  After appropriate general endotracheal anesthesia has been administered to the patient, the left breast was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion using Betadine solution.,The localization wire was cut at skin.  The patient had previously had a reduction mammoplasty in the lateral aspect of the transverse where an incision was re-incised to distance of about 4 cm.  The wire was entering the skin about 2 cm above the incision.  Superior skin flap was raised using electrocautery, and the needle localization wire was brought into the incision.  At this point, a core breast tissue of approximately 2 cm surrounding the needle was excised superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally until the tissue specimen was well below the hook of the needle localization wire.,The breast specimen was then removed from breast, and silk sutures were used to mark the superior and lateral margins.  This specimen was then sent for mammography.  Pathologist called in the room to verify that the entire needle localization wire and hook were intact in the specimen.  At this point, the breast cavity was palpated and no other abnormalities were noted.  ,The wound was irrigated.  Bleeding points were easily controlled using electrocautery.  The wound was closed in two layers using 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, 2 x 2's, Tegaderm were placed.

There was presence of hourglass constriction of the ulnar nerve.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, his left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet was positioned and tourniquet was inflated at 250 mmHg.  Perioperative antibiotics were infused.  Time-out procedure was called.  The medial epicondyle and the olecranon tip were well palpated.  The incision was initiated at equidistant between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle extending 3-4 cm proximally and 6-8 cm distally.  The ulnar nerve was identified proximally.  It was mobilized with a blunt and a sharp dissection proximally to the arcade of Struthers, which was released sharply.  The roof of the cubital tunnel was then incised and the nerve was mobilized distally to its motor branches.  The ulnar nerve was well-isolated before it entered the cubital tunnel.  The arch of the FCU was well defined.  The fascia was elevated from the nerve and both the FCU fascia and the Osborne fascia were divided protecting the nerve under direct visualization.  Distally, the dissection was carried between the 2 heads of the FCU.  Decompression of the nerve was performed between the heads of the FCU.  The muscular branches were well protected.  Similarly, the cutaneous branches in the arm and forearm were well protected.  The venous plexus proximally and distally were well protected.  The nerve was well mobilized from the cubital tunnel preserving the small longitudinal vessels accompanying it.  Proximally, multiple vascular leashes were defined near the incision of the septum into the medial epicondyle, which were also protected.  Once the in situ decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed proximally and distally, the elbow was flexed and extended.  There was no evidence of any subluxation.  Satisfactory decompression was performed.  Tourniquet was released.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and skin was approximated with staples.  A well-padded dressing was applied.  The patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well."

The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.  To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."

The patient was brought back into the Endoscopy Suite.  The aforementioned anesthesia was given.  Once the patient was properly anesthetized, bite block was placed in the patient's mouth.  Then, the patient was given the aforementioned anesthesia.  Once he was properly anesthetized, the endoscope was placed in the patient's mouth that was brought down to the cricopharyngeus muscle into the esophagus and from the esophagus to his stomach.  The air was insufflated down.  The scope was passed down to the level of the antrum where there was some evidence of gastritis seen.  The scope was passed into the duodenum and then duodenal sweep where there was a polyp seen.  The scope was pulled back into the stomach in order to flex upon itself and straightened out.  Biopsies were taken for CLO and histology of the antrum.  The scope was pulled back.  The junction was visualized.  No other masses or lesions were seen.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will recommend the patient be on some type of a H2 blocker.  Further recommendations to follow."
232,"PROCEDURE: , Urgent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiogram.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought urgently to the cardiac cath lab from the emergency room with the patient being intubated with an abnormal EKG and a cardiac arrest.  The right groin was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Under 2% lidocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was entered.  A 6-French sheath was placed.  The patient was already on anticoagulation.  Selective coronary angiograms were then performed using a left and a 3DRC catheter.  The catheters were reviewed.  The catheters were then removed and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There was some hematoma at the cath site.,RESULTS,1.  The left main was free of disease.,2.  The left anterior descending and its branches were free of disease.,3.  The circumflex was free of disease.,4.  The right coronary artery was free of disease.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve.,IMPRESSION: , Normal coronary angiogram.,"
233,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Her medical conditions driving her toward surgery include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, varicose veins, prior history of stroke.  She denies any history of cancer.  She does have a history of hepatitis which I will need to further investigate.  She complains of multiple joint pains, and heavy snoring.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Includes hysterectomy in 1995 for fibroids and varicose vein removal.  She had one ovary removed at the time of the hysterectomy as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is a single mother of one adopted child.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is a strong family history of heart disease and hypertension, as well as diabetes on both sides of her family.  Her mother is alive.  Her father is deceased from alcohol.  She has five siblings.,MEDICATIONS: , As you know she takes the following medications for her diabetes, insulin 70 units/6 units times four years, aspirin 81 mg a day, Actos 15 mg, Crestor 10 mg and CellCept 500 mg two times a day.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , She is a 54-year-old obese female.  She does not appear to have any significant residual deficits from her stroke.  There may be slight left arm weakness.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  We will have her undergo routine nutritional and psychosocial assessment.  I suspect that we can significantly improve the situation with her insulin and oral hypoglycemia, as well as hypertension, with significant weight loss.  She is otherwise at increased risk for future complications given her history, and weight loss will be a good option.  We will see her back in the office once she completes her preliminary workup and submit her for approval to the insurance company."
234,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease."

The patient agreed to proceed and informed consent was signed.,Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, a 6-French sheath was inserted in the right femoral artery.  Left and right coronary angiography was performed using 6-French JL4 and 6-French 3DRC catheters.  Then, LV gram was performed using 6-French pigtail catheter.  Post LV gram, LV-to-aortic gradient was obtained.  Then, the right femoral arteriogram was performed.  Then, the Mynx closure device was used for hemostasis.  There were no complications.,HEMODYNAMICS: , LVEDP was 9.  There was no LV-to-aortic gradient.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY:,1.  Left main is normal.  It bifurcates into LAD and left circumflex.,2.

236,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.  The patient was given 50 mg of Demerol IM with 25 mg of Phenergan."

Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed. Sterile saline was used to clean around the XXX eye as well as the rest of the face. The area was carefully dried and an eye patch and shield were taped over the XXX eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia without difficulty. (S)he was taken to the recovery area in good condition. There were no complications."
238,"As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.,Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk.  She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall.  She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.  She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.,The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved.  She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.,In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia.  She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having ""overactive bladder"", but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.,Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable ""stiffness"" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was ""not arthritis"", but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.,However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could ""barely walk"".  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were ""walking on stilts"".  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.,In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.,At that point in time, she decided to try a program of ""good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil"".,In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.,She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.,A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to ""look better"".  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.,Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.,She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.,The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory.,ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.  She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She does not smoke.  She takes one glass of wine per day.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has not had any prior surgeries.  Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawson's fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.,Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.  Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord.  It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5ºF, and weight 124 lb (dressed).,General:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.,Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.,Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion.

Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place.  After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty.  With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach.  The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion.  It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration.  Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology.  Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The scope was then slowly removed.  The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis.  The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.,IMPRESSION:,  Abdominal pain.

Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Slim-LOC plate C4, C5, C6, and C7 (22846); with intraoperative x-ray times two.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,SERVICE: , Neurosurgery.,OPERATION: , The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.  Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion.  At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."

Status post Norwood.,B. Status post Glenn.,2. Left pulmonary artery hypoplasia.,3. Diminished right ventricular systolic function.,4. Trivial neo-aortic stenosis.,5. Trivial coarctation.,6. Flow to right upper lobe more than left upper lobe from collaterals arising from branches of the aortic arch.,PROCEDURE (S):, Right heart and left heart catheterization by way of right femoral artery, right femoral vein, and right internal jugular vein.,I. PROCEDURES:, XXXXXX was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia. He was intubated. His supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24%, on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained. The patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion, including both groins and the right neck. Xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area. A 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication. A 4-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication. A 4-French pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta.,Dr. Hayes, using the SiteRite device, introduced a 5-French sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication.,A 5-French wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position. This catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery. The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French IMA catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery. After right pulmonary artery pressure was measured, this catheter was removed.,The 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels: Inferior vena cava, right atrium, left atrium, and right ventricle.,The previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta. Simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured. A pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed. Simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured.,The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French Berman catheter was advanced down the Glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery, where a pullback from right pulmonary artery to Glenn shunt was performed. An injection was then performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 8 mL per second with the Berman catheter positioned in the Glenn shunt. The 5-French Berman was removed.,A 6-French Berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle. A right ventriculogram was performed using Omnipaque 18 mL at 12 mL per second. The Berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava, where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using Omnipaque 10 mL at 8 mL per second.,The 4-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 12 mL per second.,Following the ascending angiograms, two kidneys and a bladder were noted. The catheters and sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure. The estimated blood loss was less than 30 mL, and none was replaced. Heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths. Pulse oximetry saturation, pulse in the right foot, and EKG were monitored continuously.,II. PRESSURES:,A. Left pulmonary artery, mean of 11; left capillary wedge, mean of 9; main pulmonary artery, mean of 12; right pulmonary artery, mean of 10; descending aorta, 75/45, mean of 57; right atrium, A6 to 9, V6 to 8, mean 7; left atrium, mean 8; inferior vena cava, mean 7.,B. Ascending aorta, 65/35, with a simultaneous right ventricular pressure of 70/10; descending aorta, 60/35, with a right ventricular pressure of 72/10.,C. Pullbacks, left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery, mean of 11 to mean of 12; main pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35.,INTERPRETATION:, Right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. There is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmHg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the Glenn shunt. The left atrial mean pressure is normal. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. There is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. There is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. On pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmHg gradient between the two. Systemic blood pressure is normal.,III. OXIMETRY:, Superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83.,INTERPRETATION:, Systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. Left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. The saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient.,IV. SPECIAL PROCEDURE (S):, None done.,V. CALCULATIONS:,Please see the calculation sheet. Calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. The _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. Using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. Systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. Systemic resistance was 9.8 Wood's units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. Pulmonary resistance was 2.5 Wood's units times meter squared, which is in the normal range.,VI. ANGIOGRAPHY:, The injection to the Glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open Glenn connection. The right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. The proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. The right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. The aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. There is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. Flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. There is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. There is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. There is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium.,The right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. The calculated ejection fraction from the LAO projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. The ascending aorta is dilated. There is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. On some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient's style of Norwood reconstruction. There is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right.,The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.,The ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. The coronary arteries are poorly seen. Again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. There is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. The above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted."

The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  Percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed.  A wire was then advanced in the left axillary vein using fluoroscopy.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed guidewire, a 7-French sidearm sheath was advanced over the wire into the vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Lead was passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in an apical septal location.  This was an active fixed lead and the screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  The suture sleeve was then advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  A pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the lead.  The lead was then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition."

Conservative measures at home have failed to completely resolve the symptoms.  He has been placed on previous antibiotics treatment for presumed conjunctivitis.  Please refer to clinic note for more details.  Conservative measures at home have failed to resolve the symptoms.  A nasolacrimal probing was offered as an elective procedure.  Procedure as well as inherent risks, expected outcomes, benefits, and alternatives (including continued observation) were discussed with his mother prior to scheduling surgery.  Again, a description of procedure as well as diagram instruction was provided to mother and father in the morning of the procedure.  The risks as explained included, but were not limited to temporary bleeding, persistent symptoms, recurrence need for further procedure, possible need for future stent placement or repeat probing, and anesthesia risk were all discussed.  Also a rare possibility of errant passage of the nasolacrimal probe was discussed.  Preoperative evaluation and explanation include drying of the nasolacrimal system with an explanation expected outcome/result from surgery.  No guarantees were offered.  Informed consent was signed and placed on the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Procedure as well as inherent risks were again discussed with parents prior to the procedure.  After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.

251,"CC:, Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.,HX:, This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and ""complete resection"" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal."

259,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right inguinal hernia. ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right direct inguinal hernia. ,PROCEDURE:,  Right direct inguinal hernia repair with PHS mesh system. ,ANESTHESIA:,  General with endotracheal intubation. ,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion.  An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease.  Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located.  The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine.  The cord structures were then encircled.  Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures.  I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect.  I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac.  Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice.  I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture.  I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament.  I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures.  I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl.  I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications."
260,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Asplenia syndrome.,2.  Dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava.,3.  Atrioventricular septal defect.,4.  Total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium.,5.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Congestive heart failure.,6.  Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. at bedtime.,3.  Nitro-Dur patch 0.3 mg per hour one patch daily.,4.  Phenergan syrup 6.25 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.,5.  Synthroid 0.175 mg p.o. daily.,6.

She was worked up on Friday night, 2 days earlier at Hospital, was given palliative treatment and discharged and instructed to follow up as an outpatient with an oral surgeon and given a phone number to call.  The patient was worked up initially.  On initial exam, it was noted that the patient had a left V3 paresthesia.  She had a gross malocclusion.  On the facial CT and panoramic x-ray, it was noted to be a displaced left angle fracture and nondisplaced symphysis fracture.  Alternatives were discussed with the patient and it was determined she would benefit from being taken to the operating room under general anesthesia to have a closed reduction of her fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained with the patient's mother.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room #4 at Hospital and laid in a supine position on the operating room table.  Monitor was attached and general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oromaxillofacial surgery fashion.,Surgeon approached the operating table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  A moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx and the mouth was prepped with Peridex mouthrinse, scrubbed with a toothbrush.  The Peridex was evacuated with Yankauer suction.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla from the first molar to the contralateral first molar and secured with 24-gauge surgical steel wire on the posterior teeth and 26-gauge surgical steel wire on the anterior teeth.  Same was done on the mandible.  The patient was then manipulated up in the maximum intercuspation and noted to be reproducible.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."
265,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009.  Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair.  Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.,ALLERGIES:  ,No known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Notable for heart disease.  She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery.  Her parents and brothers all had hypertension.  Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop.  He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours.  She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,VITALS:"
266,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization."
267,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with MAC anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.,Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.  The sac was excised and sent to Pathology.  The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted.  The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.,The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring.  In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger.,The Penrose drain was removed.  The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

Finally, he has decided to have them get repaired.  Plan is for surgical repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then shaved, prepped, and then sterilely prepped and draped.  IV antibiotics were given.  Ancef 1 g given.  A scrotal incision was then made in the right hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once we got to the hydrocele sac itself, we then opened and delivered the testis, drained clear fluid.  There was moderate amount of scarring on the testis itself from the tunica vaginalis.  It was then wrapped around the back and sutured in place with a running suture of 4-0 chromic in a Lord maneuver.  Once this was done, a drain was placed in the base of the scrotum and then the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  A similar procedure was performed on the left, which has also had a hydrocele of the cord, which were both addressed and closed with Lord maneuver similarly.  This testis also was normal but had moderate amount of scarring on the tunic vaginalis from this.  A similar drain was placed.  The testes were then placed back into the scrotum in a proper orientation, and the local wound instillation and wound block was then placed using 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The skin was then sutured with a running interlocking suture of 3-0 Vicryl and the drains were sutured to place with 3-0 Vicryl.  Bacitracin dressing, ABD dressing, and jock strap were placed.  The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms.,PROCEDURE: , After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.,A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.  We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions.  She should also attempt significant weight loss."
270,"HISTORY: , A 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen."

The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency.  Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed.  Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc.  Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed.  Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.  The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.,The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months.  The patient understood.  The patient was to follow up as an outpatient."

The time-out process was followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,The area of the mass, which was on the anterior lower ribs on the left side was marked and then a local anesthetic was injected.  An incision was made directly on the mass and carried down to the ribs.  This is where the several chondral cartilages of the lower ribs meet.  So I believe they were isolated in 9th rib anteriorly and I was able to encircle it.  The medial area was __________.  There was no way to perform same procedure there, so what I did, I took an electric saw and proceeded to divide the calcified cartilages of the sternum and also the attachments to the lower ribs.  There was also a separate sharp growth of the mass growing superiorly.  Apparently, I was able to excise the mass and actually it was much larger than it was palpated externally.  This may be due to an extension towards the inside of his chest.  Hemostasis was revised.  The internal mammary was intact and there was no obvious penetration of the pleural cavity.  The specimen was sent to Pathology and then we proceeded to close the defect.  Obviously, the space between the ribs cannot be approximated.  So what we did was approximate the pectoralis major operative defect and then the soft tissues and the skin with subcuticular suture of Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was minimal and he was sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.  The scope was slowly withdrawn.  The GE junction was unremarkable.  The scope was fully withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.

276,"Chief Complaint:, Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, altered mental status.,History of Present Illness:, 55 yo WM with reactive airways disease, allergic rhinitis who was in his usual state of health until he underwent a dental extraction with administration of cephalexin 1 week prior to admission. Approximately one day after the dental procedure, he began having nausea, and abdominal pain along with fatigue. The abdominal pain was described as pressure-like and was located in the epigastrium and periumbilical regions. He initially attributed the symptoms to a side effect of the antibiotic he was taking. However, with worsening of his symptoms, he presented to the ER 5 days after dental extraction.,At that time his vitals were T 99.9 ° HR 115 RR 18 BP 182/101.

Plain films done at that time revealed dilation of small bowel loops in mid-abdomen up to 3.5cm in diameter, thought to be most consistent with a paralytic ileus. The patient was discharged home with diagnosis of medication-induced gastroenteritis vs. UTI. He was instructed to stop his current antibiotic but start Levaquin, and he was given Vicodin, and phenergan for symptomatic relief.,Over the next 2 days, the patient began having fevers, non-bloody emesis, diarrhea, and confusion in addition to his persistent nausea, and abdominal pain. On the night of presentation, the patient was found by a cousin in his bathroom lethargic and disoriented. EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER. In the ER, the pt was diaphoretic, unable to answer questions appropriately, hypotensive, and febrile, with some response of bp to multiple IVF boluses (4L).

Placement of a tracheal and bilateral bronchial stents with a silicon wire stent.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Proximal trachea with high-grade occlusion blocking approximately 90% of the trachea due to granulation tissue tumor and break down of metallic stent.,3.  Multiple stent fractures in the mid portion of the trachea with granulation tissue.,4.  High-grade obstruction of the right main bronchus by stent and granulation tissue.,5.  Left main bronchus was covered by the distal portion of the stent and was only being ventilated through the struts of the stent.,6.  All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the recovery room extubated."

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis.  Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction.  There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening.  The scope was withdrawn.  A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position).  Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening.  There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material.  Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable.  In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area.  The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position.  The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek.  There were no other abnormalities noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.,2.  Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Continue antibiotics.,2.  Followup with Dr. X.,3.  If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage."
279,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.,2.  Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:  ,The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,The lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."
280,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tracheostomy change.  A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF.  The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift."
281,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.,PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  She has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.,Medical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.,The patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.,LABORATORY DATA: , INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.,2.  Restless legs syndrome.,3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide."

After appropriate anesthesia and sedation, the bronchoscope was advanced transorally due to the patient's recent history of epistaxis.  Topical lidocaine was utilized for anesthesia.  Epiglottis and vocal cords demonstrated some mild asymmetry of the true cords with right true and false vocal cord appearing slightly more prominent.  This may be normal anatomic variant.  The scope was advanced into the trachea.  The main carina was sharp in appearance.  Right upper, middle, and lower segmental bronchi as well as left upper lobe and lower lobe segmental bronchi were serially visualized.  Immediately noted were some abnormalities including circumferential narrowing and probable edema involving the posterior and apical segmental bronchi on the right and to a lesser degree the anterior segmental bronchus on the left.  No specific intrinsic masses were noted.  Under direct visualization, the scope was utilized to lavage the posterior segmental bronchus in the right upper lobe.  Also cytologic brushings and protected bacteriologic brushing specimens were obtained.  Three biopsies were attempted within the cavitary lesion in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  During lavage, some caseous appearing debris appeared intermittently.  The specimens were collected and sent to the lab.  Procedure was terminated with hemostasis having been verified.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,Throughout the procedure, the patient's vital signs and oximetry were monitored and remained within satisfactory limits.,The patient will be returned to her room with orders as per usual."

Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and anesthesia was administered.  Next, a #18-gauge needle was used to locate the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, a J wire was inserted through the needle using Seldinger technique.  The needle was withdrawn.  The distal tip location of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, a separate stab incision was made approximately 3 fingerbreadths below the wire exit site.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was pulled through the tunnel to the level of the cuff.  The catheter was cut to the appropriate length.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the J wire.  The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.

Open repair of rotator cuff using three Panalok suture anchors.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Approximately 200 cc.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a full thickness tear to the supraspinatus tendon at the insertion of the greater tuberosity.  There is moderate amount of synovitis noted throughout the glenohumeral joint.  There is a small subacromial spur noted on the very anterolateral border of the acromion.,HISTORY: , This is a 62-year-old female who previously underwent a repair of rotator cuff.  She continued to have pain within the shoulder.  She had a repeat MRI performed, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of re-tear of the rotator cuff.  She wished to proceed with a repair.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 08/21/03, she was taken to the Operative Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.  Two Panalok anchors were then placed within the trough and weaved through the suture and third Panalok anchor was placed medial to the trough and weaved through the rotator cuff.  The ends of the suture were tied down from the fixating the rotator cuff within the trough.  The rotator cuff was then further oversewed using the Panalok suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and it was then suction dried.  The deltoid muscle was reapproximated using #1 Vicryl.  A continuous infusion pump catheter was placed into the subacromial space to help with postoperative pain control.  The subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  She was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient was guarded.  She will begin pendulum exercises postoperative day #3.  She will follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for reevaluation.  Physical therapy initiated approximately six weeks postoperatively."

The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.  To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."
291,"INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION: , Increasing oxygen requirement.,HISTORY: , Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care."

Left superficial femoral artery laser atherectomy.,3.  Left superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty.  ,4.  Left external iliac artery angioplasty.,5.  Left external iliac artery stent placement.,6.  Completion angiogram.,FINDINGS:  ,This patient was brought to the OR with a non-severe stenosis of the proximal left superficial femoral artery in the upper one-third of his thigh.  He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.,Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary.  However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery.  The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.  Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area.  Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result.  The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity.  We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.,The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.,A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh.  After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting.,The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion.,The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.,The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed.  We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.  We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.  A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.,We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery.  Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for.  Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area.  Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.  He had good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally on completion.  He was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Protamine was given to partially reverse the heparin."

297,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented today with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis.  The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.,HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.  She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation.  She had full symmetrical pulses.,HEART:  There is normoactive precordium without a thrill.  There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter."

The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease.  The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.  The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches.,The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip.  Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches.  I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side.  Both ends of the sheath were released to lengthen them, and then these were repaired with 4-0 Vicryl.  It was checked to make sure that there was significant room remaining for the tendons.  This was done to prevent postoperative subluxation.,I then irrigated and closed the wounds in layers.  Marcaine with epinephrine was placed into all wounds, and dressings and splint were placed.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."

Administered general endotracheal anesthesia followed by sterile prep and drape at the patient's face and abdomen.  This included the neck accordingly.,Two platysmal sling application and operating headlight were utilized.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery along with suction Bovie cautery.,The first procedure was performed was that of a quadrilateral blepharoplasty.  Markers were applied to both upper lids in symmetrical fashion.  The skin was excised from the right upper lid first followed by appropriate muscle resection.  Minimal fat removed from the medial upper portion of the eyelid.  Hemostasis was controlled with the quadrilateral tip needle; closure with a running 7-0 nylon suture.  Attention was then turned to the lower lid.  A classic skin muscle flap was created accordingly.  Fat was resected from the middle, medial, and lateral quadrant.  The fat was allowed to open drain the arcus marginalis for appropriate contour.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery accordingly.  Skin was redraped with a conservative amount resected.  Running closure with 7-0 nylon was accomplished without difficulty.

Attention was then turned to the incision which was in the temporal hairline in curvilinear fashion following the pretragal incision to the postauricular sulcus and into and along the post-occipital hairline.  The flap was elevated without difficulty with various facelift scissors.  Hemostasis was controlled again with a pinpoint cautery as well as suction Bovie cautery.,The exact same elevation of skin flap was accomplished on the left face followed by the anterosuperior submental space with approximately 4-cm incision.  Rectus plication in the midline with a running 4-0 Mersilene was followed by some transaction of the platysma above the hairline with coagulation, cutting, and cautery.  The submental incision was closed with a running 7-0 nylon over 5-0 Monocryl.,Attention was then turned to closure of the bilateral facelift incisions after appropriate SMAS plication.  The left side of face was first closed followed by interrupted SMAS plication utilizing 4-0 wide Mersilene.  The skin was draped appropriately and appropriate tissue was resected.  A 7-mm 9-0 French drain was utilized accordingly prior to closure of the skin with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl in the post-occipital region followed by running 5-0 nylon in the postauricular surface.  Preauricular interrupted 5-0 Monocryl was followed by running 7-0 nylon.  The hairline temporal incision was closed with running 5-0 nylon.  The exact same closure was accomplished on the right side of the face with a same size 7-mm French drain.,The patient's dressing consisted of Adaptic Polysporin ointment followed by Kerlix wrap with a 3-inch Ace.,The lips and mouth were sterilely prepped and draped accordingly after application of the head drape dressing as described.  Suction lipectomy was followed in the abdomen with sterile conditions were prepped and draped accordingly.  Approximately 2.5 to 3 cc of autologous fat was injected into the upper lip of the remaining cutaneous line with blunt tip dissector after having washed the fat with saline accordingly.  Tuberculin syringes were utilized on the injection utilizing a larger blunt tip needle for the actual injection procedure.  The incision site was closed with 7-0 nylon.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with Foley catheter in position.,The patient will be admitted for overnight short stay through the cosmetic package procedure.  She will be discharged in the morning.,Estimated blood loss was less than 75 cc.  No complications noted, and the patient tolerated the procedure well."

Under effects of general endotracheal anesthesia, markings were made preoperatively for the mastopexy.  An eccentric circle was drawn around the nipple and a wedge drawn from the inferior border of the areola to the inframammary fold.  A stab incision was made bilaterally and tumescent infiltration of anesthesia, lactated ringers with 1 cc of epinephrine to 1000 cc of lactated ringers was infused with a tumescent blunt needle.  200 cc was infiltrated on each side.  This was followed by power-assisted liposuction and manual liposuction with removal of 350 cc of supernatant fat from both sides utilizing a radial tunneling technique with a 4-mm cannula.  This was followed by the epithelialization of skin between the inner circle corresponding to the diameter of the areola 4 cm diameter and the outer eccentric circle with a tangent at the 6 o'clock position.  This would result in an elevation of the nipple-areolar complex with transposition.  The epithelialization of the wedge inferiorly equalized the circumference distance between the inner circle and the outer circle.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  After the epithelialization was performed on both sides, nipple-areolar complex was transposed to new nipple position and the wedge was closed with transposition of the nipple-areolar complex beneath the transposed nipple.  Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture on deep subcutaneous tissue and dermal skin closure with running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Dermabond was applied followed by Adaptic and Kerlix in the suturing spaces supportive mildly compressive dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."

307,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Critical left carotid stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Critical left carotid stenosis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Left carotid endarterectomy with endovascular patch angioplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  Cervical block.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,The patient is a 57-year-old black female with chronic renal failure.  She does have known critical carotid artery stenosis.  She wishes to undergo bilateral carotid endarterectomy, however, it was felt necessary by Dr. X to perform cardiac catheterization.  She was admitted to the hospital yesterday with chest pain.  She has been considered for coronary artery bypass grafting.  I have been asked to address the carotid stenosis, left being more severe, this was addressed first.  Intraoperatively, an atherosclerotic plaque was noted in the common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid artery.  The internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  The external carotid artery was occluded at its origin.  When the endarterectomy was performed, the external carotid artery back-bled nicely.  The internal carotid artery had good backflow bleeding noted.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite and placed in the supine position.  Then neck, shoulder, and chest wall were prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  Longitudinal incision was created along the anterior border of the left sternocleidal mastoid muscle and this was taken through the subcutaneous tissue and platysmal muscle utilizing electrocautery.,Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery beyond the atherosclerotic back, the external carotid artery, and the superior thyroid artery were isolated and encircled with a umbilical tape.  During the dissection, facial veins were ligated with #4-0 silk ligature prior to dividing them.  Also during the dissection, ansa cervicalis, hypoglossal, and vagus nerve identified and preserved.  There was some inflammation above the carotid bulb, but this was not problematic.,The patient had been administered 5000 units of aqueous heparin after allowing adequate circulating time.  The internal carotid artery is controlled with Heifitz clip followed by the external carotid artery and the superior thyroid artery being controlled with Heifitz clips.  The common carotid artery was controlled with profunda clamp.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  A longitudinal arteriotomy was created along the posterior lateral border of the common carotid artery.  This was extended across the lobe on to the internal carotid artery.  An endarterectomy was then performed.  The ________ intima was cleared of all debris and the ________ was flushed with copious amounts of heparinized saline.  As mentioned before, the internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  This was shortened by imbricating the internal carotid artery with horizontal mattress stitches of #7-0 Prolene suture.,The wound was copiously irrigated, rather an endovascular patch was then brought on to the field.  This was cut to shape and length.  This was sutured in place with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  The suture line began at both sites.  The suture was tied in the center along the anterior and posterior walls.  Prior to completing the closure, the common carotid artery was flushed.  The internal carotid artery permitted to back bleed.  The clamp was placed after completing the closure.  The clamp was placed at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  Flow was first directed into the external carotid artery then into the internal carotid artery.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  Topical ________ Gelfoam was utilized.  Of note, during the endarterectomy, the patient did receive an additional 7000 units of aqueous heparin.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needle, and all counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable suture.  Stainless steel staples approximated skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, grossly neurologically intact."
308,"PROBLEM:,  Probable Coumadin hypersensitivity.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian female admitted to the Hospital for elective total left knee arthroplasty.  At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is originally from Maine.

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."

He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber.  His testicles are descended bilaterally.  There are no masses.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV.  I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period.  It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted.  He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission.  Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work.  I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure.  The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure.  I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions.  The patient understood this and still wished to proceed.  There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury.  The patient understood and wished to proceed."
313,"REASON FOR EVALUATION: , The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."

Chronic eustachian tube dysfunction.,2.  Retained right pressure equalization tube.,3.  Retracted left tympanic membrane.,4.  Dizziness.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Removal of the old right pressure equalizing tube with placement of a tube.  Tube used was Santa Barbara.,2.  Myringotomy with placement of a left pressure equalizing tube.  The tube used was Santa Barbara.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION: , This is a 98-year-old female whom I have known for several years.  She has a marginal hearing.  With the additional conductive loss secondary to the retraction of the tympanic membrane, her hearing aid and function deteriorated significantly.  So, we have kept sets of tubes in her ears at all times.  The major problem is that she has got small ear canals and a very sensitive external auditory canal; therefore it cannot tolerate even the wax cleaning in the clinic awake.,The patient was seen in the OR and tubes were placed.  There were no significant findings.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, she was brought to the neurosensory OR, placed under general anesthesia.  Mask airway was used.  IV had already been started.,On the right side, we removed the old tube and then cleaned the cerumen and found that it was larger than the side of the tube in perfection or perforation in tympanic membrane in the anterior inferior quadrant.  In the same area, a small Santa Barbara tube was placed.  This T-tube was cut to 80% of its original length for comfort and then positioned to point straight out and treated.  Three drops of ciprofloxacin eyedrops was placed in the ear canal.,On the left side, the tympanic membrane adhered and it was retracted and has some myringosclerosis.  Anterior, inferior incision was made.  Tympanic membrane bounced back to neutral position.  A Santa Barbara tube was cut to the 80% of the original length and placed in the hole.  Ciprofloxacin drops were placed in the ear.  Procedure completed.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATION: , None.,SPECIMEN:,  None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in a stable condition."

After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  First, the EGD was to be performed.,The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus.  Esophagitis was noted.  The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach.  The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized.  There was evidence of gastritis.  The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus.  Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement.  The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization.  The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth.  The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire.  A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel.  The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position.  The endoscope was then replaced confirming position.  Photograph was taken.  The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well.  We will begin tube feeds later this afternoon."

Orthostatic cardiac allograft transplantation utilizing total cardiopulmonary bypass.,2.  Open sternotomy covered with Ioban.,3.  Insertion of Mahurkar catheter for hemofiltration via the left common femoral vein.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position, he was prepped from shin to knees and draped in a sterile field.  A right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  A sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  The patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  A percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using Seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  After satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  After the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  A cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  The wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the Swan-Ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  Cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  The right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  First, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture.  The pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 Prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 Prolene.  The arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  Air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  The clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  Blood factors and factor VII were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  Because of excessive transfusions that were required, a Mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the Mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  Hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  After he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with Ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  The patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  This was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor VII.  Urine output for the procedure was 520 mL.  The preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  The estimated blood loss was at least 6 L.  The patient was taken to the intensive care unit in guarded condition."

The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I made a transverse incision directly over the ganglion.  Dissection was carried down through the extensor retinaculum, identifying the 3rd and the 4th compartments and retracting them.  I then excised the ganglion and its stalk.  In addition, approximately a square centimeter of the dorsal capsule was removed at the origin of stalk, leaving enough of a defect to prevent formation of a one-way valve.  We then identified the scapholunate ligament, which was uninjured.  I irrigated and closed in layers and injected Marcaine with epinephrine.  I dressed and splinted the wound.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."

Left nipple areolar reconstruction utilizing a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin.,2.  Redo right mastopexy.,ANESTHESIA,General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS,None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position and after suitable induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a frog-leg position and prepped and draped in usual fashion for the above-noted procedure.  The initial portion of the procedure was harvesting a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin region.  This was accomplished by ellipsing out a 42-mm diameter circle of skin just below the thigh, peroneal crease.  The defect was then closed with 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 chromic suture in a running locked fashion.  The area was dressed with antibiotic ointment and then a Peri-Pad.  The patient's legs were brought out frog-leg back to the midline and sterile towels were placed over the opening in the drapes.  Surgical team's gloves were changed and then attention was turned to the planning of the left nipple flap.,A maltese cross pattern was employed with a 1-cm diameter nipple and a 42-mm diameter nipple areolar complex.  Once the maltese cross had been designed on the breast at the point where the nipple was to be placed, the areas of the portion of flap were de-epithelialized.  Then, when this had been completed, the dermis about the maltese cross was incised full thickness to allow mobilization of the flap to form the neonipple.  At this point, a Bovie electrocautery was used to control bleeding points and then 4-0 chromic suture was used to suture the arms of the flap together creating the nipple.  When this had been completed, the skin graft, which had been harvested from the left groin was brought onto the field where it was prepared by removing all subcutaneous tissue from the posterior aspect of the graft and carefully removing the hair follicles encountered within the graft.  At this point, the graft was sutured into position in the defect using 3-0 chromic in an interrupted fashion and then trimming the ellipse to an appropriate circle to fill the areola.  At this point, 4-0 chromic was used to run around the perimeter of the full-thickness skin graft and then at this point the nipple was delivered through a cruciate incision in the middle of the skin graft and then inset appropriately with 4-0 chromic.  The areolar skin graft was pie crusted.  Then, at this point, the area of areola was dressed with silicone gel sheeting.  A silo was placed over the neonipple with 3-0 nylon through the apex of the neonipple to support the nipple in an erect position.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were then applied.,At this point, attention was turned to the right breast where a 2-cm wide ellipse transversely oriented and with its inferior most aspect just inferior to the transverse mastopexy incision line was made.  The skin was removed from the area and then a layered closure of 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 PDS in a running subcuticular fashion was carried out.  When this had been completed, the Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied to the transverse right breast incision.  Fluff dressings were applied to the right breast as well as the area around the silo on the left breast around the reconstructed nipple areola.  The patient was then placed in Surgi-Bra and then was taken from the operating room to the recovery room in good condition."

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery."

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples.

Laparoscopy with removal of tubal pregnancy and right partial salpingectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 100 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 25-year-old African-American female, gravida 7, para-1-0-5-1 with two prior spontaneous abortions with three terminations who presents with pelvic pain.  She does have a slowly increasing beta HCG starting at 500 to 849 and the max to 900.  Ultrasound showed a complex right lower quadrant mass with free fluid in the pelvis.  It was decided to perform a laparoscopy for the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus was approximately 10 weeks' in size, mobile, and anteverted.  There were no adnexal masses appreciated although there was some fullness in the right lower quadrant.  The cervical os appeared parous.,Laparoscopic findings revealed a right ectopic pregnancy, which was just distal to the right fallopian tube and attached to the fimbria as well as adherent to the right ovary.  There were some pelvic adhesions in the right abdominal wall as well.  The left fallopian tube and ovary and uterus appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  There was a small amount of blood in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped, placed under general anesthesia, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vaginal vault and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank dilators up to a #10.  A sharp curette was then introduced and curettage was performed obtaining a mild amount of tissue.  The tissue was sent to pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed in the patient's cervix.  Gloves were changed.  The attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was placed without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty in abdominal wall.  The placement was confirmed with a laparoscope.  It was then decided to put a #5 step trocar approximately 2 cm above the pubis symphysis in order to manipulate the pelvic contents.  The above findings were then noted.  Because the tubal pregnancy was adherent to the ovary, an additional port was placed in the right lateral aspect of the patient's abdomen.  A #12 step trocar port was placed under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator, the mass was hydro-dissected off of the right ovary and further shelled away with graspers.  This was removed with the gallbladder grasper through the right lateral port site.  There was a small amount of oozing at the distal portion of the fimbria where the mass has been attached.  Partial salpingectomy was therefore performed.  This was done using the LigaSure.  The LigaSure was clamped across the portion of the tube including distal tube and ligated and transected.  Good hemostasis was obtained in all of the right adnexal structures.  The pelvis was then copiously suction irrigated.  The area again was then visualized and again found to be hemostatic.  The instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen under direct visualization.  The abdomen was then desufflated and the #11 step trocar was removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed from the patient's vagina.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle count were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively as an outpatient."

353,"OPERATION,1.  Insertion of a left subclavian Tesio hemodialysis catheter.,2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and MAC anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and neck were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was used to infiltrate the skin in the region of the procedure.  Next a #18-gauge finder needle was used to locate the left subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire through the needle.  This process was repeated.  The 2 J wires and their distal tips were confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, the subcutaneous tunnel was created.  The distal tips of the individual Tesio hemodialysis catheters were pulled through to the level of the cuff.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the individual J wires.  The dilator and wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Tesio hemodialysis catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The process was repeated.  Both distal tips were noted to be in good position.  The Tesio hemodialysis catheters were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The catheters were secured at the cuff level with a 2-0 nylon.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition."

Repair of lateral meniscus using two fast fixed meniscal repair sutures.,3.  Partial medial meniscectomy.,4.  Partial chondroplasty of patella.,5.  Lateral retinacular release.,6.  Open medial plication as well of the right knee.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:,  130 minutes at 325 mmHg.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint.  The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity."

356,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only ""comes and goes."",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test"

Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.  However, the above was reviewed with the patient in great detail as well as with her daughter and mother who were at the bedsite at this time as well."

General endotracheal anesthesia.,2.  9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PATHOLOGY: , Thyroid.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a female with a history of Graves disease.  Suppression was attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She presents today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition."
361,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above.  He was seen a few weeks ago for routine followup, and he was noted for microhematuria.  Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done.  He presents today for followup.  He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues.  Last stone episode was over a year ago.  No history of smoking.  Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence.,Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis.

Lateral femoral chondroplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY AND INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 47-year-old female who has knee pain since 03/10/03 after falling on ice.  The patient states she has had inability to bear significant weight and had swelling, popping, and giving away, failing conservative treatment and underwent an operative procedure.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/08/03, placed on the operative table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the right lower extremity was placed in a Johnson knee holder.  Care was ensured that all bony prominences were well padded and she was positioned and secured.  After adequately positioned, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Attention was then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portals, both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively.  The arthroscope was advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch.  All compartments were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment.  The patella was noted to have grade-II changes of the inferior surface, otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove.  There was mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage.  The medial gutter was visualized.  There was no evidence of loose body.  The medial compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade III-IV chondromalacia changes with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment.  There was also noted to be a degenerative meniscal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.  The arthroscopic probe was then introduced and the meniscus and chondral surfaces were probed throughout its entirety and photos were taken.  At this point, a meniscal shaver was then introduced and the chondral surfaces were debrided as well as any loose bodies removed.  This gave a smooth shoulder to the chondral lesion.  After this, the meniscus was debrided until it had been smooth over the frayed edges.  At this point, the shaver was removed.  The meniscal binder was then introduced and the meniscus was further debrided until the tear was adequately contained at this point.  The shaver was reintroduced and all particles were again removed and the meniscus was smoothed over the edge.  The probe was then reintroduced and the shaver removed, the meniscus was probed ___________ and now found to be stable.  At this point, attention was directed to the rest of the knee.  The ACL was examined.  It was intact and stable.  The lateral compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a grade II-III changes of the lateral femoral condyle.  Again, with the edge of some friability at the shoulder of this cartilage lesion.  There was noted to be some mild degenerative fraying of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.  The probe was introduced and the remaining meniscus appeared stable.  This was then removed and the stapler was introduced.  A chondroplasty and meniscoplasty were then performed until adequately debrided and smoothed over.  The lateral gutter was then visualized.  There was no evidence of loose bodies.  Attention was then redirected back to the medial and femoral condyles.,At this point, a 0.62 K-wire was then placed in through the initial portal, medial portal, as well as an additional poke hole, so we can gain access and proper orientation to the medial femoral lesion.  Microfacial technique was then used to introduce the K-wire into the subchondral bone in multiple areas until we had evidence of some bleeding to allow ___________ of this lesion.  After this was performed, the shaver was then reintroduced and the loose bodies and loose fragments were further debrided.  At this point, the shaver was then moved to the suprapatellar pouch and the patellar chondroplasty was then performed until adequately debrided.  Again, all compartments were then re-visualized and there was no further evidence of other pathology or loose bodies.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All instrumentation was removed.  Approximately 20 cc of 0.25% plain Marcaine was injected into the portal site and the remaining portion intraarticular.  Sterile dressings of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in supine position.,DISPOSITION:  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The patient was transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."
363,"REASON FOR EXAM: , Atrial flutter/cardioversion.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient received sedation prior to the cardioversion with a transesophageal echo as dictated earlier with a total of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 6 mg of Versed.  The pads were applied in the anterior-posterior approach.  The synchronized cardioversion with biphasic energy delivered at 150 J. First attempt was unsuccessful.  Second attempt at 200 J with anterior-posterior approach.  With biphasic synchronized energy delivered was also unsuccessful with degeneration of the atrial flutter into atrial fibrillation.,The patient was decided to be on wave control and amiodarone and reattempted cardioversion after anticoagulation for four to six weeks and because of the reduced LV function, the success of the rate without antiarrhythmic may be low.,IMPRESSION: , Unsuccessful direct current cardioversion with permanent atrial fibrillation."

Leukoplakia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of left true vocal cord stripping.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  The patient is a 33-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic hoarseness and bilateral true vocal cord lesions, and leukoplakia discovered on a fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy in the office.  Discussed risks, complications, and consequences of a surgical biopsy of the left true vocal cord and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operative suite by anesthesia, placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the operative table was turned 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed followed by the patient being placed in reverse Trendelenburg.,After this, a mouthguard was placed in the upper teeth and a Dedo laryngoscope was placed in the patient's oral cavity and advanced through the oral cavity in the oropharynx down into the hypopharynx.  The patient's larynx was then brought into view with the true vocal cords hidden underneath what appeared to be redundant false vocal cords.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed and appeared to have an extensive area of leukoplakia extending from the posterior one-third up to the anterior third.  The false vocal cord also appeared to be very full on the left side along with fullness in the subglottic region.  The patient's anterior commissure appeared to be clear.  The false cord on the right side also appeared to be very redundant and overshadowing the true vocal cord.  Once the true vocal cord was retracted laterally, there was revealed a second area of leukoplakia involving the right true vocal cord in the anterior one-third aspect.  The patient's subglottic region was very edematous and with redundant mucosal tissue.  The areas of leukoplakia appeared to be cobblestoned in appearance, irregularly bordered, and very hard to the touch.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed, was stripped from posteriorly to anteriorly utilizing a #45 laryngeal forceps.  After this, the patient had pressure placed upon this area with tropical adrenaline and a rectal swab to maintain hemostasis.  The specimen was passed off the field and was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Hemostasis was maintained on the left side.  Prior to taking this biopsy, the Louie arm was attached to the laryngoscope and then suspended on the Mayo stand.  The Zeiss operating microscope was then brought into view to directly visualize the vocal cords.  The biopsies were taken under direct visualization utilizing the Zeiss operating microscope.  After the specimen was taken and the laryngoscope was desuspended from the Mayo stand and Louie arm was removed, the scope was then pulled more cephalad and the piriform sinuses, valecula, and base of the tongue were all directly visualized, which appeared normal except for the left base of tongue appeared to be full.  This area was biopsied multiple times with a straight laryngeal forceps and passed off the field and sent to Pathology as specimen.  The scope was then pulled back into the superior aspect of hypopharynx into the oropharynx and the oral cavity demonstrated no signs of any gross lesions.  A bimanual examination was then performed, which again demonstrated a fullness on the left base of tongue region with no signs of any other gross lesions.  There were no signs of any palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.  The tooth guard was removed and the patient was then turned back to anesthesia.  The patient did receive intraoperatively 10 mg of Decadron.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.,The patient was transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure well.  The patient will be sent home with prescriptions for Medrol DOSEPAK, Tylenol with Codeine, Elixir, and amoxicillin 250 mg per 5 cc."
365,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.,He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.,2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.

There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family."
366,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Left neck dissection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a very nice gentleman, who has had thyroid cancer, papillary cell type, removed with a total thyroidectomy and then subsequently recurrent disease was removed with a paratracheal dissection.  He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.  The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.  A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications."

Status post spontaneous vaginal delivery.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Hysteroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with paracervical block.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 cc.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female that presents 7 months status post spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications at that time.  The patient has had abnormal uterine bleeding since her delivery with an ultrasound showing a 6 cm x 6 cm fundal mass suspicious either for retained products or endometrial polyp.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was consented and seen in the preoperative suite.  She was taken to the operative suite, placed in a dorsal lithotomy position, and placed under IV sedation.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with the red Robinson catheter which produced approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was done, was performed by Dr. X and Dr. Z.  The uterus was found to be anteverted, mobile, fully involuted to a pre-pregnancy stage.  The cervix and vagina were grossly normal with no obvious masses or deformities.  A weighted speculum was placed in the posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.,The uterus was sounded to 8 cm.  The cervix was sterilely dilated with Hank dilator and then Hagar dilator.  At the time of blunt dilation, it was noticed that the dilator passed posteriorly with greater ease than it had previously.  The dilation was discontinued at that time because it was complete and the hysteroscope was placed into the uterus.  Under direct visualization, the ostia were within normal limits.  The endometrial lining was hyperplastic, however, there was no evidence of retained products or endometrial polyps.  The hyperplastic tissue did not appear to have calcification or other abnormalities.  There was a small area of the lower uterine segment posteriorly that was suspicious for endometrial perforation, however this area was hemostatic, no evidence of bowel involvement and was approximately 1 x 1 cm in nature.  The hysteroscope was removed and a sharp curette was placed intrauterine very carefully using a anterior wall for guidance.  Endometrial curettings were obtained and the posterior aspect suspicious for perforation was gently probed and seemed to have clamped down since the endometrial curetting.  The endometrial sampling was placed on Telfa pad and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  A rectal exam was performed at the end of the procedure which showed no hematoma formation in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was a normal consistency of the cervix and the normal step-off.  The uterine curette was removed as well as the vulsellum tenaculum and the weighted speculum.  The cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The patient was taken off the dorsal lithotomy position and recovered from her IV sedation in the recovery room.  The patient will be sent home once stable from anesthesia.  She will be instructed to followup in the office in two weeks for discussion of the pathologic report of the endometrial curettings.  The patient is sent home on Tylenol #3 prescription as she is allergic to Motrin.  The patient is instructed to refrain from intercourse douching or using tampons for the next two weeks.  The patient is also instructed to contact us if she has any problems with further bleeding, fevers, or difficulty with urination."

Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot.,2.  Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise."
370,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Iron deficiency anemia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Diverticulosis.,PROCEDURE:,  Colonoscopy.,MEDICATIONS: , MAC.,PROCEDURE: , The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice.  Preparation was good, although there was some residual material in the cecum that was difficult to clear completely.  The mucosa was normal throughout the colon.  No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted.  Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation.  A retroflex view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Diverticulosis in the sigmoid.,2.  Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.,2.  Screening colonoscopy in 2 years.,3.  Additional evaluation for other causes of anemia may be appropriate."
371,"PROCEDURE:, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.,MEDICATIONS:, General anesthesia.,The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.,3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. NPO except ice chips today.,2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.,3. Follow up biopsies and cytology."

No lymphadenitis is palpated.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TESTING:,  CBC was done, which had a hemoglobin of 7.7 and hematocrit of 22.6.  Neutrophils were 81%.  The RDW was 18.5, and the rest of the values were all within normal limits and unremarkable.  Chemistry had a sodium of 134, a glucose of 132, calcium is 8.2, and rest of the values are unremarkable.  Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4.  Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs.  Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's.  The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen.  Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: , The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect.  The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.,DIAGNOSES,1.  HEMATURIA.,2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.,3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.,4.  URINARY OBSTRUCTION.,CONDITION ON DISPOSITION:  ,Fair, but improved.,DISPOSITION: , To home with his son.,PLAN: , We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation.  The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight.  The patient was encouraged to drink extra water.  The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern."
374,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Right heart catheterization.,INDICATION: , Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance.  Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed.  An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained.  The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,  Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8.  Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%.  Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22.,IMPRESSION:  ,Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance.,PLAN: , Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor.  The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy.  We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d.  We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily.  We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy.  As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil."
375,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Possible inflammatory bowel disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Polyp of the sigmoid colon.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Total colonoscopy with photography and polypectomy.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient had a history of ischiorectal abscess.  He has been evaluated now for inflammatory bowel disease.  Upon endoscopy, the colon prep was good.  We were able to reach the cecum without difficulty.  There are no diverticluli, inflammatory bowel disease, strictures, or obstructing lesions.  There was a pedunculated polyp approximately 4.5 cm in size located in the sigmoid colon at approximately 35 cm.  This large polyp was removed using the snare technique.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite, prepped and draped in left lateral decubitus position.  IV sedation was given by Anesthesia Department.  The Olympus videoscope was inserted into anus.  Using air insufflation, the colonoscope was advanced through the anus to the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum, the above gross findings were noted.  The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and carefully examined the lumen of the bowel.  When the polyp again was visualized, the snare was passed around the polyp.  It required at least two to three passes of the snare to remove the polyp in its totality.  There was a large stalk on the polyp.  ________ the polyp had been removed down to the junction of the polyp in the stalk, which appeared to be cauterized and no residual adenomatous tissue was present.  No bleeding was identified.  The colonoscope was then removed and patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition."

378,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Nasal deformity, status post rhinoplasty.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE:,  Revision rhinoplasty (CPT 30450).  Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.,The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest."

The patient was noted to have irregular contractions.  She was given 1 dose of subcutaneous terbutaline which resolved her contraction.  A bedside ultrasound was performed which revealed single intrauterine pregnancy and complete breech presentation.  There was noted to be adequate fluid.  Using manual pressure, the breech was manipulated in a forward roll fashion until a vertex presentation was obtained.  Fetal heart tones were checked intermittently during the procedure and were noted to be reassuring.  Following successful external cephalic version, the patient was placed on continuous external fetal monitoring.  She was noted to have a reassuring and reactive tracing for 1 hour following the external cephalic version.  She did not have regular contractions and therefore she was felt to be stable for discharge to home.  She was given appropriate labor instructions."

Repair of one-half full-thickness left lower lid defect by tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap from left upper lid to left lower lid.,2.  Repair of left upper and lateral canthal defect by primary approximation to lateral canthal tendon remnant.,ASSISTANT: , None.,ANESTHESIA: , Attended local by Strickland and Associates.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  Dressing was removed from the left eye, which revealed the defect as noted above.  After systemic administration of alfentanil, local anesthetic was infiltrated into the left upper lid, left lateral canthus, and left lower eyelid.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic fashion.  Protective scleral shell was placed in the left eye.  A 4-0 silk traction sutures placed through the upper eyelid margin.  The medial aspect of the remaining lower eyelid was freshened with straight iris scissors and fibrin was removed from the inferior aspect of the wound.  The eyelid was everted and a tarsoconjunctival pedicle flap was developed by incision of the tarsus approximately 3-1/2-4 mm from the lid margin the full width of the eyelid.  Relaxing incisions were made both medially and laterally and Mueller's muscle was subsequently dissected free from the superior tarsal border.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then anchored to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and one 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The protective scleral shell was removed from the eye.  The medial aspect of the eyelid was advanced temporally.  The tarsoconjunctival pedicle was then cut to size and the tarsus was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  The conjunctiva and lower lid retractors were attached to the advanced tarsal edge with a running 7-0 Vicryl suture.  The upper eyelid wound was present.  It was advanced to the advanced tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally.  The conjunctival pedicle was slightly trimmed to make a lateral canthal tendon and the upper eyelid was advanced to the tarsoconjunctival pedicle temporally with an interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture, it was then secured to the lateral orbital rim with two interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin muscle flap was then elevated, was draped superiorly and nasally and was anchored to the medial aspect of the eyelid with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  Burrows triangle was removed as was necessary to create smooth wound closure, which was closed with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture.  Temporally the orbicularis was resuspended from the advanced skin muscle flap with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture to the periosteum overlying the lateral orbital rim.  The skin muscle flap was secured to the underlying tarsoconjunctival pedicle with vertical mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl followed by wound closure temporally with interrupted 7-0 Vicryl suture with removal of a burrow's triangle as was necessary to create smooth wound closure.  Erythromycin ointment was then applied to the eye and to the wound followed by multiple eye pads with moderate pressure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in excellent condition.  There were no apparent complications."
381,"HISTORY:  ,I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient today, referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations.  As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.,ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.,GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The patient has a stable-appearing tracheostomy tube site and the stoma appears to be without signs of infection.  The previous incision was vertical in nature and there is no hypertrophic scar formation.  No adenopathy noted.  No stridor noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerve VII intact bilaterally.  No signs of tremor.,LUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds in all four quadrants.  No wheezes noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,PROCEDURE: , Limited bronchoscopy and then fiberoptic laryngoscopy.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support with tracheostomy tube placement.,2.  Difficulty tolerating tracheostomy tubes secondary to swallow discomfort and neck irritation with no further need for tracheostomy tube over the past few months with the patient tolerating capped tracheostomy tube 24 hours a day.,3.  History of coronary artery disease.,4.  History of myocardial infarction.,5.  History of cirrhosis of liver.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly."
382,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:,Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  Continue aggressive medical therapy."

Placement of anterior cervical plate with a Zephyr C4 to C6.,6.  Fluoroscopic guidance.,7.  Microscopic dissection.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 60 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a patient who presents with progressive weakness in the left upper extremity as well as imbalance.  He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6.  Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to recovery in good condition."

We have discussed locations, the nature of trigonocephaly's repair, metopic synostosis repair with bilateral fronto-orbital advancement, forehead reconstruction, and bone graft.  We have discussed risks and benefits.  Risks included, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgeries, minimal possibility of death, the alternatives, devastating bleeding, anesthesia, death, dehiscence, infection.  The parents understand, decide to proceed with surgery.  Informed consent was obtained and we proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  Lines were placed by Anesthesia and then the head of the bed was turned to 100 degrees.  The patient was once more positioned and padded in the usual manner.  The incision was marked with the help of a marking pen and local anesthetic was infiltrated after prepping the area one time, then the definitive prep and draping of the area was done.,The procedure began with an incision through the full-thickness of the skin into the subcutaneous tissue down to the subgaleal plane.  The subgaleal plane was developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery.  Raney clips were applied to both flaps to prevent significant bleeding.  Then, we proceed with craniotomy part and Dr. Y proceeded with this part of the procedure.  I assisted her and this will be described in a different operative report.  Then, the area corresponding to the C-shaped osteotomy was marked and then we proceed in conjunction with Dr. Y to develop these osteotomies with the help of the Midas by retracting the contents of the skull at the level of the anterior fossa as well as the orbital contents with the help of a ribbon retractor.  The osteotomies were done with the Midas and some irrigation.  There was an osteotomy done at the level of the frontozygomatic suture just posterior to the frontozygomatic suture and then these osteotomies continued down intraorbitally and lateral through the zygoma to the level of the intraorbital rim.  This was done on both sides.  Hemostasis achieved with bone wax and electrocautery.  Once the osteotomies were completed, __________ of the osteotomy sites allowed advancements.  On the left side, there was a minor fracture to the superior orbital rim that was plated.  The bone grafts were customized placing these at the level of the sphenoid bone in the posterior aspect of the orbital rim.  The temporalis muscle was advanced and attached to the orbital rim with holes that have been drilled with Midas and a 3-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches.  The forehead flaps were attached with the help of absorbable mesh.  The forehead portions were applied to the fronto-orbital advancement of fronto-orbital piece with the help of Synthes mesh and 3-mm screws.  Hemostasis was checked.  The flaps were retracted back into position.,The wound was closed with 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures, 4-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches, and 5-0 running fast absorbing gut.

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.  The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  Patient tolerated the procedure well."

Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Uniplate construction, C5-C6, (22845); with intraoperative x-ray times two.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,SERVICE: , Neurosurgery.,OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."
394,"ADENOIDECTOMY,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought into the operating room suite, anesthesia administered via endotracheal tube.  Following this the patient was draped in standard fashion.  The Crowe-Davis mouth gag was inserted in the oral cavity.  The palate and tonsils were inspected, the palate was suspended with a red rubber catheter passed through the right nostril.  Following this, the mirror was used to visualize the adenoid pad and an adenoid curet was seated against the vomer.  The adenoid pad was removed without difficulty.  The nasopharynx was packed.  Following this, the nasopharynx was unpacked, several discrete bleeding sites were gently coagulated with electrocautery and the nasopharynx and oral cavity were irrigated.

397,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:,Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  Continue aggressive medical therapy."

400,"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety."
401,"SUBJECTIVE:  ,This 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department for three days of cough, claims that he has brought up some green and grayish sputum.

There was no accessory muscle use.,HEART:  Sounded regular.,SKIN:  Normal color, warm and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically he was alert.,IMPRESSION: , Viral syndrome, which we have been seeing in many cases throughout the week.  The patient asked me about antibiotics and I did not see a need to do this since he did not appear to have an infection other than viral given his normal temperature, normal pulse, normal respiratory rate, and near normal oxygen.  The patient being on Coumadin I explained to him that unless there was a solid reason to put him on antibiotics, he would be advised not to do so because antibiotics can alter the gut floor causing the INR to increase while on Coumadin which may cause serious bleeding.  The patient understands this.  I then asked him if the cough was annoying him, he said it was.  I offered him a cough syrup, which he agreed to take.  The patient was then discharged with Tussionex Pennkinetic a hydrocodone time-release cough syrup.  I told to check in three days, if the symptoms were not getting better.  The patient appeared to be content with this treatment and was discharged in approximately 30 to 45 minutes later.  His wife calls me very angry that I did not give him antibiotics.  I explained her exactly what I explained to him that they were not indicative at this time, and she became very upset saying that they came there specifically for antibiotics and I explained again that antibiotics are not indicated for viral infection and that I did not think he had a bacterial infection.,DIAGNOSIS: , Viral respiratory illness."

There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove.  The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee was suctioned dry.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon was identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There was excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl.  Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture.  Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia."

The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition."

She was counseled to undergo staging laparotomy.,FINDINGS:,  Examination under anesthesia revealed a small uterus with no nodularity.  During the laparotomy, the uterus was small, mobile, and did not show any evidence of extrauterine spread of disease.  Other abdominal viscera, including the diaphragm, liver, spleen, omentum, small and large bowel, and peritoneal surfaces, were palpably normal.  There was no evidence of residual neoplasm after removal of the uterus.  The uterus itself showed no serosal abnormalities and the tubes and ovaries were unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthesia was induced, after which she was examined, prepped and draped.,A vertical midline incision was made and fascia was divided.  The peritoneum was entered without difficulty and washings were obtained.  The abdomen was explored with findings as noted.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneal spaces were opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided, and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.,Retroperitoneal spaces were then opened, allowing exposure of pelvic vessels and ureters.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments were isolated, divided, and doubly ligated.  The uterine artery pedicles were skeletonized, clamped, divided, and suture ligated.  Additional pedicles were developed on each side of the cervix, after which tissue was divided and suture ligated.  When the base of the cervix was reached, the vagina was cross-clamped and divided, allowing removal of the uterus with attached tubes and ovaries.  Angle stitches of o-Vicryl were placed, incorporating the uterosacral ligaments and the vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.  The pelvis was irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were repositioned to allow exposure for lymphadenectomy.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to incise lymphatic tissues.  Borders of the pelvic node dissection included the common iliac bifurcation superiorly, the psoas muscle laterally, the cross-over of the deep circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior border of dissection was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  Ligaclips were applied where necessary.  After the lymphadenectomy was performed bilaterally, excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were again repositioned to allow exposure of para-aortic nodes.  Lymph node tissue was mobilized, Ligaclips were applied, and the tissue was excised.  The pelvis was again irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was run and no evidence of disease was seen.,All packs and retractors were removed and the abdominal wall was closed using a running Smead-Jones closure with #1 permanent monofilament suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were irrigated and a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running stitch and skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch.  The final sponge, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure. ,The patient was then awakened from her anesthetic and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition."
407,"PROCEDURES:,1.  Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure."
408,"PROCEDURE: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy."

The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.  The patient is scheduled to be seen in follow-up in the office tomorrow, but should any complications arise this evening, the patient is to contact me immediately."

Median sternotomy incision was made and the left mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff of the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The pericardium was opened.  The pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula and bypass was instituted.  A retrograde cardioplegic cannula was placed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 Prolene suture in the right atrial wall into the coronary sinus and tied to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegic needle sump combination was placed in the ascending aorta and tied in place with 4-0 Prolene.  The ascending aorta was crossclamped.  Cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given to the ascending aorta followed by sumping through the ascending aorta followed by cold retrograde potassium cardioplegia.  The obtuse marginal coronary artery was identified and opened and end-to-side anastomosis was performed to the reversed autogenous saphenous vein with running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given and the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde potassium cardioplegia were given.  The mammary artery was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed through the left internal mammary artery with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  The mammary pedicle was sutured to the heart with interrupted 5-0 Prolene suture.  A warm antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given.  The aortic crossclamp was removed.  The partial occlusion clamp was placed.  Aortotomies were made.  The veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  A partial occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Ventricular and atrial pacing wires were placed.  The patient was fully warmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was decannulated in the routine fashion and Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal and left pleural chest tube were placed.  The sternum was closed with interrupted wire, linea alba with running 0 Prolene, the sternal fascia was closed with running 0 Prolene, the subcutaneous tissue with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."

Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.,2.  Pelvic adhesions.,3.  Pelvic pain.,4.  Fibroid uterus.,5.  Enterocele.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.,2.  McCall's culdoplasty.,3.  Cystoscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 350 cc.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian female with complaints of long standing pelvic pain throughout the menstrual cycle and worse with menstruation, uncontrolled with Anaprox DS also with complaints of dyspareunia.  On laparoscopy in May of 2003, PID, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids were demonstrated.  The patient desires definitive treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY:  ,Uterus was retroverted and somewhat boggy on bimanual examination without any palpable adnexal abnormalities.  On laparoscopic examination, the uterus was quite soft and boggy consistent with the uterine adenomyosis.  There was also evidence of fibroid change in the right fundal aspect of the uterus.  There was a white exudative material covering the uterus as well as bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes.  There were filmy adhesions to the right pelvic side wall, as well as left pelvic side wall.,PROCEDURE: , The patient taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was initially placed and was noted to be draining clear to yellow urine.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The bladder was elevated and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus sounded to 7 cm and the cervix was then progressively dilated.  A #20 Hank dilator, which was left within the cervix used in conjunction with the vulsellum tenaculum as a uterine manipulator.  At this time, after the gloves were changed, attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen.  A small approximately 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made with the scalpel.  A Veress needle was then inserted through this incision and a pneumoperitoneum was created with CO2 gas with appropriate volumes and pressures.  A #10 mm step trocar was then inserted through this site and intraabdominal placing was confirmed with the laparoscope.  On entrance into the patient's abdomen and pelvis, survey of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the operative area to be relatively free of adhesions except for the right pelvic saddle in which there were filmy adhesions.  There was also white exudate noted covering the surface of the uterus and adnexa and the uterus had a quite boggy appearance.  At this time, under transillumination in the left anterior axillary line, a second incision was made with a scalpel and through this site a #12 mm step trocar was inserted under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  A third incision was made in the right anterior axillary line under transillumination and through this site a second #12 mm step trocar was placed under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  Then 2 cm above the pubic symphysis in the midline and fourth incision was made and a #5 mm step trocar was inserted through this site.  The uterus was elevated and deviated to the patient's right and infundibulopelvic ligament on the left was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  The Endo-GIA was placed through the left sided port and was fired was to cross the infundibulopelvic ligament and down passed to the level of the round ligament, transecting and stapling at the same time.  Attention was then turned to the right adnexa.,The uterus was brought over to the patient's left and the right infundibulopelvic ligament was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  An Endo-GIA was used to transect and staple this vasculature and down passed to the level of round ligament.  At this time, there was noted to be a small remnant of the round ligament on the right and a Harmonic scalpel was used to complete the transection and was found to be hemostatic.  In addition, on the left the same procedure was performed to completely transect the round ligament on the left and a good hemostasis was noted.  At this time, the uterus was dropped and the vesicouterine peritoneum was grasped with graspers.  The bladder was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and hemostasis was appreciated.  The anterior cervix of the uterus was scored in the midline up to the level of the fundus with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and then out to the adnexa bilaterally to aid in orientation during the vaginal portion of the procedure.  At this time, copious suction irrigation was performed and the operative sites were found to be hemostatic.  The pneumoperitoneum was the evacuated and the attention was then turned to the vaginal portion of the procedure.  The weighted speculum was placed into the patient's vagina.  At this time, the Foley catheter was noted to have ________ and there was noted to be a small puncture site noted into the Foley bulb.  The Foley catheter was replaced and the bladder was to be filled at a later time with methylene blue to rule out any bladder injury during the laparoscopic part of the procedure.  The cervix was then grasped from right to left with a Lahey clamps and the anterior vaginal mucosa was placed on stretch with aid of Allis clamps.  The vaginal mucosa anteriorly was then incised with aid of a scalpel from the 9 o'clock position to 3 o'clock position.  The anterior vaginal mucosa and bladder were suctioned and were then dissected away from the lower uterine segment with the aid of Mayo scissors and blunt dissection until anteriorly the peritoneal cavity was entered at which time the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, using Lahey clamps serially following the ________ placed by the Harmonic scalpel from above were followed up to the pubic uterine fundus until the uterus was delivered into the vagina anteriorly.  At this time, two curved Heaney clamps were placed across the uterine artery on the right.  This was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The second clamp was advanced to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex and this was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  Attention was then turned to the left uterine artery which was again doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  This second clamp was then advanced to capture the vasculature and the cardinal ligament complex.  This was again transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.,Next, the uterosacral were clamped off with the curved Heaney clamps and this clamp was met in the midline by another clamp just underneath the cervix and clamping off of the vaginal cuff.  Next the uterus, ovaries and cervix were transected away from the vaginal cuff with the aid of double pointed scissors and this specimen was handed off to pathology.  At this time, the bladder was instilled with approximately 800 cc of methylene blue and there was no evidence of any leak of blue dye as could be seen from the prospective of the vaginal portion of the procedure.  Next, the posterior vaginal cuff and posterior peritoneum were incorporated in a running lock stitch of #0 Chromic beginning at the 9'o clock position over to the 3'o clock position.  Next, the anterior vaginal mucosa was grasped with the Allis clamp and the peritoneum was identified anteriorly.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then closed with #0 Chromic suture figure-of-eight stitch with care taken to incorporate the anterior vaginal mucosa, the anterior peritoneum, and the previously closed posterior vaginal mucosa and the posterior peritoneum.  Two additional sutures medially were placed and these were tagged and not tied in place.  A #0 Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle was used to perform the McCall's culdoplasty type approximation with the vaginal cuff to open and the uterosacral ligament visualized.  This was then tied in place and the remainder of the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Chromic suture with figure-of-eight stitches.  At this time, the gloves were changed and attention was returned to the laparoscopic portion of the procedure at which time the abdomen was re-insufflated and the patient was placed in Trendelenburg.  The bowel was moved out of the way and copious suction irrigation was performed and all operative areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder was again filled with approximately 400 cc methylene blue and from the laparoscopic ________ point there was no evidence of leakage of blue dye at this time.  The pneumoperitoneum was then evacuated and a cystoscopy was performed filling the bladder with approximately 400 cc of normal saline and there was noted to be a pinpoint perforation right on bladder dome which was found to be hemostatic and was not found to have any leakage at this time.  The bladder was then drained and the Foley catheter was replaced and after gloves changed, attention was turned to the abdomen with the laparoscopic instruments removed from the patient's abdomen.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine in total were injected at incision site for additional analgesia.  The Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to recovery in stable condition.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The specimens include the uterus, cervix, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes.  The patient will have her Foley catheter maintained for approximately 7 to 10 days."
417,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 54-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for weight reduction secondary to diabetes.  She did attend diabetes education classes at Abc Clinic.  She comes however, wanting to really work at weight reduction.  She indicates that she has been on the Atkins' diet for about two years and lost about ten pounds.  She is now following a veggie diet which she learned about in Poland originally.  She has been on it for three weeks and intends to follow it for another three weeks.  This does not allow any fruits or grains or starchy vegetables or meats.  She does eat nuts for protein.  She is wanting to know if she is at risk of having a severe low blood sugar reaction in this form of diet.  She also wants to know that if she gets skinny enough, if the diabetes will go away.  Her problem time, blood sugar wise, is in the morning.  She states that if she eats too much in the evening that her blood sugars are always higher the next morning.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight:  189 pounds.  Reported height:  5 feet 5 inches.  BMI is approximately 31-1/2.  Diabetes medications include metformin 500 mg daily.  Lab from 5/12/04:  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.4%.,A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for weight reduction.  A 1200-calorie meal plan was recommended.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's diet history reflects that she is highly restricting carbohydrates in her food intake.  She does not have blood sugar records with her for me to review, but we discussed strategies for improving blood sugar control in the morning.  This primarily included a recommendation of including some solid protein with her bedtime snack which could be done in the form of nuts.  She is doing some physical activity two to three times a week.  This includes aerobic walking with weights on her arms and her ankles.  She is likely going to need to increase frequency in this area to help support weight reduction.  Her basal metabolic rate was estimated at 1415 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements for weight maintenance are estimated at 1881 calories a day.  A 1200-calorie meal plan should support a weight loss of at least one pound a week.,PLAN:,  Recommend patient increase the frequency of her walking to five days a week.  Encouraged a 30-minute duration.  Also recommend patient include some solid protein with her bedtime snack to help address fasting blood sugar elevations.  And lastly, I encouraged caloric intake of just under 1200 calories daily.  Recommend keeping food records and tracking caloric intake.  It is unlikely that her blood sugars would drop significantly low on the current dose of Glucophage.  However, I encouraged her to be careful not to reduce calories below 1000 calories daily.  She may want to consider a multivitamin as well.  This was a one-hour consultation."

419,"PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , The right femoral area was draped and prepped in the usual fashion after Xylocaine infiltration.  A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  This was nondominant.  Several catheters were used.  Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used.  A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast.  Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results.  There were no complications.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Right coronary artery:  This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2.  Left main trunk:  A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3.  Left anterior descending:  Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4.  Circumflex:  Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk.  The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5.  Left ventriculogram:  Normal volume in diastole and systole.  Normal systolic function is present.  There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1.  Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  Dominant circumflex system.  Severe disease of the posterior descending.  Mild left main trunk disease.,2.  Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.  The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant.  This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.  The case will be reviewed with a cardiac surgeon."

The placenta was normal in appearance with a three-vessel cord.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  Patient was brought to the operating room with an IV running and a Foley catheter in place, satisfactory spinal anesthesia was administered following which a wedge was placed under the right hip.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made and carried sharply down to the level of fascia.  The fascia was incised transversely.  The fascia was dissected away from the underlying rectus muscles.  With sharp and blunt dissection, rectus muscles were divided in midline.  The perineum was entered bluntly.  The incision was carried vertically with scissors.  Transverse incision was made across the bladder peritoneum.  The bladder was dissected away from the underlying lower uterine segment.  Bladder retractor was placed to protect the bladder.  The lower uterine segment was entered sharply with a scalpel.  Incision was carried transversely with bandage scissors.  Clear amniotic fluids were encountered.  The infant was out of the pelvis and was in oblique vertex presentation.  The head was brought down into the incision and delivered easily as were the shoulders and body.  The mouth and oropharynx were suctioned vigorously.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was passed off to the waiting pediatrician in satisfactory condition.  Cord bloods were taken.,Placenta was delivered spontaneously and found to be intact.  Uterus was explored and found to be empty.  Uterus was delivered through the abdominal incision and massaged vigorously.  Intravenous Pitocin was administered.  T clamps were placed about the margins of the uterine incision, which was closed primarily with a running locking stitch of 0 Vicryl with adequate hemostasis.  Secondary running locking stitch was placed for extra strength to the wound.  At this point, attention was diverted to the patient's tubes, a Babcock clamp grasped the isthmic portion of each tube and approximately 1-cm knuckle on either side was tied off with two lengths of 0 plain catgut.  Intervening knuckle was excised and passed off the field.  The proximal end of the tubal mucosa was cauterized.  Cul-de-sac and gutters were suctioned vigorously.  The uterus was returned to its proper anatomic position in the abdomen.  The fascia was closed with a simple running stitch of 0 PDS.,The skin was closed with running subcuticular of 4-0 Monocryl.  Uterus was expressed of its contents.  Patient was brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.  There was 600 cc of blood loss.

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars."

428,"Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D."
429,"Chief Complaint:, Dark urine and generalized weakness.,History of Present Illness:,40 year old Hispanic male presented to the emergency room complaining of generalized weakness, fatigue and dark urine for one week. In addition, he stated that his family had noticed yellowing of his skin and eyes, though he himself had not noticed.,He did complain of subjective fever and chills along with occasional night sweats during the prior week or so and he noted anorexia for 3-4 weeks leading to 26 pound weight loss (213 lbs. to 187 lbs.). He was nauseated but denied vomiting. He did admit to intermittent abdominal discomfort which he could not localize. In addition, he denied any history of liver disease, but had undergone cholecystectomy many years previous.,Past Medical History:, DM II-HbA1c unknown,Past Surgical History:, Cholecystectomy without complication,Family History:, Mother with diabetes and hypertension.

No murmurs, gallops or rubs,PULM: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without rhonchi, rales or wheezes,ABD: Soft with mild RUQ tenderness to deep palpation, Murphy’s sign absent. Bowel sounds present. Hepatomegaly with liver edge 3 cm below costal margin. Splenic tip palpable.,RECTAL: Guaiac negative,EXT: Shotty inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, largest node 2cm,NEURO: Strength 5/5 throughout, sensation intact, reflexes symmetric. No focal abnormality identified. No asterixis,SKIN: Jaundice, no rash. No petechiae, gynecomastia or spider angiomata.,Hospital Course:,The patient was admitted to the hospital to begin workup of liver failure. Initial labs were considered to be consistent with an obstructive pattern, so further imaging was obtained. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed lymphadenopathy and a markedly enlarged liver. His abdominal pain was controlled with mild narcotics and he was noted to have decreasing jaundice by hospital day 4. An US guided liver biopsy revealed only acute granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. The overall architecture of the liver was noted to be well preserved.,Gastroenterology was consulted for EGD and ERCP. The EGD was normal and the ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy without evidence of obstruction. In addition, they performed an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of two lymph-nodes, one in the subcarinal region and one near the celiac plexus. Again, pathologic results were insufficient to make a tissue diagnosis.,By the second week of hospitalization, the patient was having intermittent low-grade fevers and again experiencing night-sweats. He remained jaundice. Given the previous negative biopsies, surgery was consulted to perform an excisional biopsy of the right groin lymph node, which revealed no evidence of carcinoma, negative AFB and GMS stains and a single noncaseating granuloma.,By his fourth week of hospitalization, he remained ill with evidence of ongoing liver failure. Surgery performed an open liver biopsy and lymph node resection.,STUDIES (HISTORICAL):,CT abdomen: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes near the porta hepatis and peri-pancreatic regions. The largest node measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The liver is markedly enlarged (23cm) with a heterogenous pattern of enhancement. The spleen size is at the upper limit of normal. Pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are within normal limits. Visualized portions of the lung parenchyma are grossly normal.,CT neck: No abnormalities noted,CT head: No intracranial abnormalities,RUQ US (for biopsy): Heterogenous liver with lymphadenopathy.,ERCP: No filling defect noted; normal pancreatic duct visualized. Normal visualization of the biliary tree, no strictures. Normal exam."
430,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right renal mass.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  100 mL.,X-RAYS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Right radical nephrectomy specimen.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,DRAINS:,  16-French Foley catheter per urethra.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old woman recently diagnosed with 6.5 cm right upper pole renal mass.  This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen."
431,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.,On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.,She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.,Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.,Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.,MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,SKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.,LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.,LUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.  Dressings are clean and dry.,EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.  Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.,LABORATORY DATA:,  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow."

Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal."

She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right femoral region was infiltrated with subcutaneous lidocaine, adequate anesthesia was obtained.  The right femoral artery was entered with _______ modified Seldinger technique and a J wire was passed.  The needle was exchanged for 6 French sheath.  The wire was removed.  The sheath was washed with sterile saline.  Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed.  A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD.  The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro.  The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures.  The balloon was deflated and angiography demonstrated establishment of flow.  Following this, the lesion was stented with a 2.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent at 10 atmospheres.  The balloon was deflated, reinflated at 12 atmospheres, deflated and removed.  Final angiography demonstrated excellent clinical result.  Additional angiography was performed with a wire out.  Following this, the wire and the catheter was removed.  Following this, the right coronary was selectively cannulated with diagnostic catheter and angiographic views were obtained in multiple views.  This catheter was removed.  The pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle and left ventriculography was performed with pullback pressures across the aortic valve.  At the end of procedure, wires and catheter were removed.  Right femoral angiography was performed and a right femoral Angio-Seal kit was deployed at the right femoral arteriotomy site.

434,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization."
435,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  Chest pain, possible syncopal spells.,She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD.,She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy.  Since then she just says ""things have changed"".  She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel ""like cramps"" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of ""falling"", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.  Her weight has not changed in the past year.,MEDICATIONS: , Naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day.,ALLERGIES:,  Sulfa.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink.

Extremities:  No edema and good distal pulses.,EKG: , Normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.,ECHOCARDIOGRAM (FOR SYNCOPE): , Essentially normal study.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.,2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does.,2.  Drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed.,3.  Flexeril 10 mg q 6 p.r.n.,4.  I have asked her to return should the syncopal spells continue."

440,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."

442,"Chief Complaint:, Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.,History of Present Illness:, A 50-year-old Asian female comes to The Methodist Hospital on January 2, 2001, complaining of a 3-day history of abdominal pain. The pain is described as crampy in the central part of her abdomen, and is associated with nausea and vomiting during the previous 24 hours. The patient denied passing any stool or gas per rectum for the previous 24 hours. She had been admitted recently to the hospital from December 19 to December 23, 2000, with a three-week history of fevers to 101.8, diaphoresis, anorexia, malaise and skin ""lumps"". She described a total of three ""lumps"". The first one started as a pin-sized lesion that grew up and then disappeared, the other two didn't resolve. They were described as ""erythematous nodular lesions on the extensor surface of the left arm."" A punch biopsy was obtained from these skin lesions, showing deep dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue that contained ""multiple granulomas composed of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without caseating necrosis"". However, one granuloma in the deep dermis, showed a hint of central necrosis. Special stains for acid - fast bacilli and fungi were reported as negative. No atypia or malignancy was noted. A CT scan of the chest was obtained on December 19, 2000 and showed numerous masses with spiculated borders bilaterally, predominately in the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes. No cavitary lesions, mediastinal masses or definite hilar adenopathy were reported. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy which showed fragments of bronchial mucosa and wall with underlying lung parenchyma. Minimal to mild interstitial lymphocytes with a few microfoci of neutrophils were seen. They were also able to appreciate intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates.

446,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina.  In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her.  I advised her to call 911, which she did.  While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , The patient has been having arm pain for several months.  She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  The decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel.  She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  This is her usual angina.  She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Detrol LA 2 mg once a day.,2.  Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day.,3.  Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.,4.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,5.  Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.,6.  Toprol-XL 25 mg once a day which I started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be tolerating.,7.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,8.  Plavix 75 mg once a day.,9.  Diovan 160 mg once a day.,10.  Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.,11.  Norvasc 5 mg once a day.,12.  Lipitor 5 mg once a day.,13.  Evista 60 mg once a day.,ALLERGIES: , ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE.  SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.  No morning headaches or fatigue.  No psychiatric diagnosis.  No psoriasis, no lupus.  Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47,  respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100%,HEENT:  Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.,NECK:  Veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.,HEART:  S1 and S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI nondisplaced.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.,EXTREMITIES:  Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses grossly intact.  Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses.,LABORATORY DATA: , EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease.,Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.  BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9.  Glucose 110.  Magnesium 2.5.  ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08.  INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc.  I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion.  I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function.  She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  The patient desires full resuscitation status."

I discussed the indications and the need for procedure with the patient in detail, and he has given consent to proceed.  He has been given prophylactic antibiotics.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , Once satisfactory sedation have been obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table.  Genitalia was shaved and then prepped with Betadine scrub and paint solution and were draped sterilely.  The procedure itself was started by grasping the right vas deferens in the scrotum, and bringing it up to the level of the skin.  The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath.  The vas was brought out of the incision carefully.  A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed.  The free ends were cauterized and were tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves.  After securing hemostasis with a cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized.,Attention was now turned to the left side.  The vas was grasped and brought up to the level of the skin.  The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath.  The vas was brought out of the incision carefully.  A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed.  The free ends were cauterized and tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves.  After securing hemostasis with the cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized.,Bacitracin ointment was applied as well as dry sterile dressing.  The patient was awakened and was returned to Recovery in satisfactory condition."
448,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left pleural effusion, parapneumonic, loculated.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left pleural effusion, parapneumonic, loculated.,OPERATION: , Left chest tube placement.,IV SEDATION: , 5 mg of Versed total given under pulse ox monitoring, 1% lidocaine local infiltration.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient semi recumbent and supine the left anterolateral chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 1% lidocaine was liberally infiltrated into the skin, subcutaneous tissue, deep fascia and the anterior axillary line just below the level of the nipple.  The incision was made and deepened through the different layers to reach the intercostal space.  The pleura was entered on top of the underlying rib and finger digital palpation was performed.  Multiple loculations were encountered.  Break up of loculations was performed posteriorly and a chest tube was directed posteriorly.  Only a small amount of fluid was noted to come out initially.  This was sent for various studies.  Soft adhesions were encountered.  The plan was to obtain a chest x-ray and start Activase installation."
449,"PROCEDURE: , Circumcision.,Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained.,The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion.  The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution.  The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure.  A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine.  A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis.  A ** Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes.  During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade.  With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding.  The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well.  Care instructions were given to the parents."
450,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute acalculous cholecystitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute acalculous cholecystitis.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of cholecystostomy tube under ultrasound guidance.,ANESTHESIA: , Xylocaine 1% With Epinephrine.,INDICATIONS: , Patient is a pleasant 75-year-old gentleman who is about one week status post an acute MI who also has acute cholecystitis.  Because it is not safe to take him to the operating room for general anesthetic, I recommended he undergo the above-named procedure.  Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.,TECHNIQUE: , Patient was identified, then taken to the Radiology suite, where the area of interest was identified using ultrasound and prepped with Betadine solution, draped in sterile fashion.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine and after multiple attempts, the gallbladder was finally cannulated by Dr. Kindred using the Cook 18-French needle.  The guidewire was then placed and via Seldinger technique, a 10-French pigtail catheter was placed within the gallbladder, secured using the Cook catheter method, and dressings were applied and patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
451,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Possible exposure to ant bait.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 14-month-old child who apparently was near the sink, got into the childproof cabinet and pulled out ant bait that had Borax in it.  It had 11 mL of this fluid in it.  She spilled it on her, had it on her hands.  Parents were not sure whether she ingested any of it.  So, they brought her in for evaluation.  They did not note any symptoms of any type.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Negative.  Generally very healthy.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , The child has not been having any coughing, gagging, vomiting, or other symptoms.  Acting perfectly normal.  Family mostly noted that she had spilled it on the ground around her, had it on her hands, and on her clothes.  They did not witness that she ingested any, but did not see anything her mouth.,MEDICATIONS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Stable vital signs and normal pulse oximetry.  GENERAL:  The child is very active, cheerful youngster, in no distress whatsoever.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is clear, moist, and well hydrated.  I do not see any evidence of any sort of liquid on the face.  Her clothing did have the substance on the clothes, but I did not see any evidence of anything on her torso.  Apparently, she had some on her hands that has been wiped off.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  I discussed the case with Poison Control and apparently this is actually relatively small quantity and it is likely to be a nontoxic ingestion if she even ingested, which should does not appear likely to be the case.,IMPRESSION: , Exposure to ant bait.,PLAN: , At this point, it is fairly unlikely that this child ingested any significant amount, if at all, which seems unlikely.  She is not exhibiting any symptoms and I explained to the parents that if she develops any vomiting, she should be brought back for reevaluation.  So, the patient is discharged in stable condition."
452,"PROCEDURE: , Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block.,INDICATION: , Sacroiliac joint pain.,INFORMED CONSENT: , The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE:  ,Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS: , This was then repeated on the left side.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION:  ,Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to resume normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at the PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately 1 week."
453,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available."

Lumbar discogram L5-S1.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially."

In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.

Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.,NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion.,HEART:  Regular.,ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.  He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned."
456,"PROCEDURE: , Primary right shoulder arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression.,PATIENT PROFILE:,  This is a 42-year-old female.  Refer to note in patient chart for documentation of history and physical.  Due to the nature of the patient's increasing pain, surgery is recommended.  The alternatives, risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The patient verbalized understanding of the risks as well as the alternatives to surgery.  The patient wished to proceed with operative intervention.  A signed and witnessed informed consent was placed on the chart.  Prior to initiation of the procedure, patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the surgeon in the pre-op area, and the operative site was marked by the patient and verified by the surgeon.,PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: , Acute complete tear of the supraspinatus, Shoulder impingement syndrome.,POST-OP DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute complete tear of the supraspinatus, Shoulder impingement syndrome.,ANESTHESIA: , General - Endotracheal.,FINDINGS:,ACROMION:,1.  There was a medium-sized (5 - 10 mm) anterior acromial spur.,2.  The subacromial bursa was inflamed.,3.  The subacromial bursa was thickened.,4.  There was thickening of the coracoacromial ligament.,LIGAMENTS / CAPSULE: , Joint capsule within normal limits.,LABRUM: , The labrum is within normal limits.,ROTATOR CUFF: , Full thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, 5 mm anterior to posterior, by 10 mm medial to lateral.  Muscles and Tendons:  The biceps tendon is within normal limits.,JOINT:,  Normal appearance of the glenoid and humeral surfaces.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,PATIENT POSITIONING: , Following induction of anesthesia, the patient was placed in the beach-chair position on the standard operating table.  All body parts were well padded and protected to make sure there were no pressure points.  Subsequently, the surgical area was prepped and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion with Betadine.,INCISION TYPE:,1.  Scope Ports:  Anterior Portal.,2.  Scope Ports:  Posterior Portal.,3.  Scope Ports:  Accessory Anterior Portal.,INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS:,1.  The arthroscope and instruments were introduced into the shoulder joint through the arthroscopic portals.,2.  The subacromial space and bursa, biceps tendon, coracoacromial and glenohumeral ligaments, biceps tendon, rotator cuff, supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, teres minor, capsulo-labral complex, capsule, glenoid labrum, humeral head, and glenoid, including the inner and outer surfaces of the rotator cuff, were visualized and probed.,3.  The subacromial bursa, subacromial soft tissues and frayed rotator cuff tissue were resected and debrided using a motorized resector and 4.5 Synovial Resector.,4.  The anterior portion of the acromion and acromial spur were resected with the 5.5 acromionizer burr.  Approximately 5 mm of bone was removed.  The coracoacromial ligament was released with the bony resection.  The shoulder joint was thoroughly irrigated.,5.  The edges of the cuff tissue were prepared, prior to the fixation, using the motorized resector.,6.  The supraspinatus tendon was reattached and sutured using the arthroscopic knot pusher and Mitek knotless anchor system and curved pointed suture passer and large bore cannula (to pass the sutures).  The repair was accomplished in a side-to-side and a tendon-to-bone fashion using three double loaded Mitek G IV suture anchors with 1 PDS suture.,7.  The repair was stable to palpation with the probe and watertight.,8.  The arthroscope and instruments were removed from the shoulder.,PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN: , No pathology specimens.,WOUND CLOSURE:,  The joint was thoroughly irrigated with 7 L of sterile saline.  The portal sites were infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Vicryl using interrupted subcuticular technique.,DRAINS / DRESSING:,  Applied sterile dressing including gauze, iodoform gauze and Elastoplast.,SPONGE / INSTRUMENT / NEEDLE COUNTS:,  Final counts were correct."
457,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , New-onset seizure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then."

460,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today’s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday’s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen."
461,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left distal ureteral stone.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left distal ureteral stone.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Cystopyelogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone basket extraction, stent exchange with a string attached.,ANESTHESIA:,  LMA.,EBL: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.  The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones.  The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed.  Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system.  Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed.  A semirigid ureteroscopy was done.  A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter.  Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces.  Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed.  Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative.  There were no further stones.  Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal.  The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent.  There were no further stones.  Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours.  Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed.  There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day.  The patient's family was instructed how to do so.  The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home.  The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition."
462,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Open repair of right pectoralis major tendon.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with an interscalene block.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Needle and sponge counts were done and correct.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant male who works in sales, who was performing heavy bench press exercises when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder.  The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered.  The clavicular head was noted to be intact.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative markings were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection was carried down.  The deltoid was retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded.  The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation was not performed.  The wound was then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein was not injured during the case.  The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing was then placed.  Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block.  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression."
463,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged.  He, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on Coumadin.,The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead EKG here.  Otherwise, no chest pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide.  He completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia.  Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia.,MEDICATIONS:,As outpatient,,1.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2.  Altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3.  Zocor 20 mg once a day.,4.  Flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.,5.  Coumadin as directed by our office.,ALLERGIES: , TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE.  HE DENIES SHRIMP, SEA FOOD OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , He has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an MI, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  No use of illicit drugs.  He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife.  He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  He has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  Affect appropriate.  He is quite oriented and pleasant.  No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.

Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  Extremities without significant edema.  Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings."

465,"OPERATION: , Left lower lobectomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was induced, the appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position.  The left chest and back were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A right lateral thoracotomy incision was made.  Subcutaneous flaps were raised.  The anterior border of the latissimus dorsi was freed up, and the muscle was retracted posteriorly.  The posterior border of the pectoralis was freed up and it was retracted anteriorly.  The 5th intercostal space was entered.,The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down with electrocautery.  The major fissure was then taken down and arteries identified.  The artery was dissected free and it was divided with an Endo GIA stapler.  The vein was then dissected free and divided with an Endo GIA stapler.  The bronchus was then cleaned of all nodal tissue.  A TA-30 green loaded stapler was then placed across this, fired, and main bronchus divided distal to the stapler.,Then the lobe was removed and sent to pathology where margins were found to be free of tumor.  Level 9, level 13, level 11, and level 6 nodes were taken for permanent cell specimen.  Hemostasis noted.  Posterior 28-French and anterior 24-French chest tubes were placed.,The wounds were closed with #2 Vicryl.  A subcutaneous drain was placed.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with running 3-0 Dexon, skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch."
466,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes.,PROCEDURE: , Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,110 mL of crystalloid.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left.  The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."
467,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cataract, nuclear sclerotic, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cataract, nuclear sclerotic, right eye.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: , Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation, right eye.,ANESTHESIA: , Topical tetracaine, intracameral lidocaine, monitored anesthesia care.,IOL: , AMO Model SI40 NB, power *** diopters.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: , This patient has been experiencing difficulty with eyesight regarding activities in their daily life.  There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  By examination, this was found to be related to cataracts.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained.,Questions were answered in personal conference with the patient to ensure that the patient had a good grasp of the operative goals, risks, and alternatives involved as well as the postoperative instructions.  A preoperative surgical history and physical examination was done to ensure that the patient was in optimal general health for cataract surgery.  To minimize and decrease the chance of bacterial infection, the patient was started on a course of antibiotic drops for two days prior to surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a comfortable supine position.  The operative table was placed in Trendelenburg head-up tilt to decrease orbital congestion and posterior vitreous pressure.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  The lids and periorbita were prepped with full-strength Betadine solution with care taken to concentrate on sterilizing the eyelid margins.  The conjunctival cul-de-sac was also prepped in dilute Betadine solution.  The fornices were also prepped.  The drape was done meticulously to ensure complete eyelash inclusion.,An eyelid speculum was placed to separate the eyelids.  A paracentesis site was made.  Intracameral preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  Amvisc Plus was then used to stabilize the anterior chamber.  A 3-mm diamond blade was then used to carefully construct a clear corneal incision in the temporal location.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome was used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsular flap was removed.  A 27-gauge blunt cannula was used for hydrodissection.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer technique was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove remaining cortex with the I/A handpiece.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  The intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag.  The lens was then dialed into position.  The lens was well-centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure along with stromal hydration.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and well-centered intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Zymar and Pred Forte drops were applied.  A firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours."

The patient deteriorated with several CVAs and had became encephalopathic requiring a ventilator-dependency with respiratory failure.  The patient also had neuromuscular dysfunction.  After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  First, the EGD was to be performed.,The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus.  Esophagitis was noted.  The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach.  The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized.  There was evidence of gastritis.  The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus.  Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement.  The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization.  The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth.  The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire.  A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel.  The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position.  The endoscope was then replaced confirming position.  Photograph was taken.  The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well.  We will begin tube feeds later this afternoon."

Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia.  However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible.  Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours.  We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture.  If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.,As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH.  Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.,2.  Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above.  No immediate indication for anticoagulation.  If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy.  This was discussed with Dr. X.  Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.,3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient is clinically euvolemic.  Elevated BNP possibly secondary to infarct or renal insufficiency.  Follow volume status closely.  Follow serial BNPs.,4.  Followup.  The patient will be followed while in-house, recommendations made as clinically appropriate."
470,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.,Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically."
471,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago.  She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes.  She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:  , The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided.  In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She was noted to have some pools of stool.  This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:,  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.  She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.  Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated."
472,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Umbilical hernia repair.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated.  The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect.  The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia.,The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
473,"PROCEDURE: , Colonoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Perianal abscess.,MEDICATIONS:,  MAC.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum.  The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis.  Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction.  There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening.  The scope was withdrawn.  A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position).  Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening.  There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material.  Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable.  In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area.  The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position.  The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek.  There were no other abnormalities noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.,2.  Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Continue antibiotics.,2.  Followup with Dr. X.,3.  If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage."

476,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.

479,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  Impending open heart surgery for closure of ventricular septal defect in a 4-month-old girl.,Procedures were done under general anesthesia.  The patient was already in the operating room under general anesthesia.  Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin and gentamicin was already given prior to beginning the procedures.,PROCEDURE #1:,  Insertion of transesophageal echocardiography probe.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #1: , The probe was well lubricated and with digital manipulation, was passed into the esophagus without resistance.  The probe was placed so that the larger diameter was in the anterior-posterior position during insertion.  The probe was used by the pediatric cardiologist for preoperative and postoperative diagnostic echocardiography.  At the end, it was removed without trauma and there was no blood tingeing.  It is to be noted that approximately 30 minutes after removing the cannula, I inserted a 14-French suction tube to empty the stomach and there were a few mL of blood secretions that were suctioned.  There was no overt bleeding.,PROCEDURE #2: , Attempted and unsuccessful insertion of arterial venous lines.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #2:,  Both groins were prepped and draped.  The patient was placed at 10 degrees head-up position.  A Cook 4-French double-lumen 8-cm catheter kit was opened.  Using the 21-gauge needle that comes with the kit, several attempts were made to insert central venous and then an arterial line in the left groin.  There were several successful punctures of these vessels, but I was unable to advance Seldinger wire.  After removal of the needles, the area was compressed digitally for approximately 5 minutes.  There was a small hematoma that was not growing.  Initially, the left leg was mildly mottled with prolonged capillary refill of approximately 3 seconds.  Using 1% lidocaine, I infiltrated the vessels of the groin both medial and lateral to the vascular sheath.  Further observation, the capillary refill and circulation of the left leg became more than adequate.  The O2 saturation monitor that was on the left toe functioned well throughout the procedures, from the beginning to the end.  At the end of the procedure, the circulation of the leg was intact.,"
480,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm Gore-Tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Membranous pulmonary atresia.,2.  Atrial septal defect.,3.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,1.  Pulmonary valvotomy surgical.,2.  Aortopulmonary artery central shunt.,3.  Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.,CURRENT DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Pulmonary valve stenosis supplemented to hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.,2.  Mild right ventricle outflow tract obstruction due to supple pulmonic narrowing.,3.  Small right coronary artery to main pulmonary fistula.,4.  Static encephalopathy.,5.  Cerebral palsy.,MANAGEMENT: , The case to be discussed with combined Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.  Given the mild degree of outflow tract obstruction in this sedentary patient, aggressive intervention is not indicated.  Conservative outpatient management is to be recommended.  Further patient care will be directed by Dr. X."
481,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition."
482,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,OPERATION:,  Cysto stent removal.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local MAC.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose.  The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."

Chondroplasty of the left knee as well.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 80 cc.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: , 19 minutes.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old male with left knee pain for approximately two years secondary to hockey injury where he did have a prior MCL sprain.  He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition."

The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.,The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the ""Scotty Dog,"" After obtaining the ""Scotty Dog"" view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.,The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the ""Scotty Dog"" technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis."
