667,Don't you agree with me?
668,I feel like going outside.

2183,I don't know why Tom refused to do that.
2184,They like to get together and drink.
2185,I warned you in advance.

2222,I've done as you've asked.
2223,You inspired me.

2234,Who's this guy?
2235,I think I should've bought more food.
2236,Pardon me for a moment.
2237,We must always be prepared for the worst.
2238,I have nothing to do today.
2239,Why did this happen?
2240,You can rest.
2241,Where's my husband?
2242,My house is just across the street.
2243,I didn't see the explosion. I just felt it.
2244,What shall we eat tonight?
2245,Have you had trouble sleeping?
2246,It's spring.
2247,The mountain top is covered with snow.
2248,Just remember that I hate making decisions.

2252,Tom couldn't see what Mary was looking at.
2253,There's something else I want to do.

2275,That's Tom's father.
2276,I take it that you are fully acquainted with the facts.
2277,I'm not really planning to do that.

2279,I phoned him.
2280,You've got three hours.
2281,He is my classmate.

2284,The ice cream melted on the sidewalk.

2289,"Don't speak so fast, please."

2302,The criminal escaped from the prison.
2303,Did you already do your homework?

2483,"You'd better hurry, or you'll miss the train."

2626,Tom is extremely patient.
2627,We need food.
2628,I don't care what people say.

2647,It wasn't me who translated this text.
2648,What do I care?
2649,We've known that from the beginning.
2650,Do you want to eat noodles or rice?
2651,My plan is better than yours.
2652,I wonder whether the plane will arrive on time.
2653,We all felt sorry for Tom.
2654,I'm sure that Tom will explain it to you eventually.
2655,That's not a pencil. It's a pen.
2656,She put the dirty dishes in the sink.
2657,I hate homework.
2658,"You're still a dentist, aren't you?"

2674,Please let go of my arm.
2675,"Push the button, please."

2688,I was in Tokyo yesterday.

2700,Do you want an oatmeal cookie?
2701,I usually eat a lot.
2702,I'll try and contact Tom now.

2706,The country's falling apart.

3236,I go to church once in a blue moon.
3237,I'd rather have ice cream.
3238,Tom is being quiet.
3239,Does everyone in Sweden have blonde hair and blue eyes?
3240,Mother insists that we should be home by seven in the evening.

3244,I can't dance very well.
3245,I've never seen a pink fridge.
3246,You've done it!
3247,Good afternoon.
3248,That's our house.
3249,Why didn't you believe me?
3250,Why can't Tom do the same?
3251,Tom spends a lot of time playing football.
3252,I was very rich three years ago.
3253,May I touch this?
3254,Haven't you decided yet?
3255,Tom is skinny.
3256,Is there a problem with the motor?
3257,I'm proud of you guys.
3258,Some of the balls are yellow.
3259,I'm not kidding.
3260,I've changed my daily routine.
3261,I bought fresh bread.
3262,This question is not easy.
3263,How do you view this matter?
3264,The asking price is astronomical.
3265,These trees were planted by them.
3266,What have I got to lose?
3267,Please tell us more.
3268,I can't keep this up.
3269,I'm seeing them tonight.
3270,It's not rocket science.
3271,It's money down the drain.
3272,I felt like crying.
3273,What was the fight all about?
3274,Enjoy your holidays.
3275,What's it sound like?
3276,Tom kissed my cousin.

3283,We don't have to talk about this now.
3284,The radio is a bit loud.
3285,"Venice, Italy is one of the wonders of the world."
3286,Tom isn't at all sure what he should do.
3287,"Three passengers were saved, but the remaining passengers drowned."
3288,It was an act of God.
3289,I'm your doctor.
3290,Tom hasn't cleaned the kitchen yet.
3291,Do you want me to run the dishwasher?
3292,It's too loud.
3293,My father has a blue and gray tie.
3294,We ate slowly.
3295,He is a waiter and also an actor.
3296,I'm considering it seriously.
3297,We ran out of gas on our way there.
3298,I missed the last two lessons.
3299,I'd like shoes like that.
3300,You didn't need to buy the book.
3301,I'm a bit tired.
3302,Why won't anybody talk about this?
3303,I swear it wasn't my fault.
3304,Who knows what might happen over the next few weeks?
3305,We canoed downstream.
3306,He's totally dependent on his parents.
3307,We confessed.
3308,He offered to help me.
3309,But I can't understand them very well.
3310,Tom is a celebrity.
3311,My dad helped me tie my tie.
3312,Tom is seldom late for school.
3313,Tom isn't interested in the details.
3314,There is a man waiting for you at the door.
3315,Can you do that?
3316,Here's your coffee.
3317,Can we have a talk?
3318,Tom bought flowers.
3319,Can I turn on the TV?
3320,Do you understand me?

3322,I know that I might need to do that on Monday.
3323,How many pencils did you buy?
3324,Can somebody open the door for me?
3325,Did you say something?
3326,You have to accept your role.
3327,No one said this would work.
3328,"Turn the TV down, please."
3329,Tom's blood type is O negative.
3330,Stop pretending.
3331,"Can I have the bill, please?"
3332,These shoes are too small.
3333,I know you can't do that very well.
3334,I'm missing something.
3335,You're old.
3336,When are you going to Europe?
3337,Why are you running?
3338,Nobody recognized you.
3339,I can't move an inch.
3340,I made a typing error.
3341,"If I were you, I'd get out of the way."
3342,Tom isn't suicidal.
3343,It isn't a virus.
3344,Tom is a perfect gentleman.
3345,We've done everything we could.
3346,I live on the first floor.
3347,They've got explosives.
3348,How do I get to the beach?
3349,"Go to sleep, Tom."
3350,I wonder whose idea this was.
3351,Her father passed away last week.
3352,Is it OK if we do this later?
3353,Johnny Depp is my favorite actor.
3354,We really need to get going.
3355,What would you like for dessert?
3356,Tom doesn't know where his umbrella is.

3361,I want another beer.
3362,A captain is in charge of his ship and its crew.
3363,I think you're awesome.

3365,You ain't seen nothing yet.
3366,Are you free tonight?
3367,Your dress is very nice.
3368,This reminds me of you.
3369,Why can't we spend more time together?
3370,Tom can't help.
3371,Tom said that he wouldn't mind doing that for me.
3372,Tom looks fat.
3373,Let's go out.
3374,I play in a band.
3375,Leave tomorrow.
3376,I need many books.
3377,I loosened my shoelaces.
3378,Do you like pears?
3379,Tom can hardly see without his glasses.
3380,"Why are you doing this, Tom?"
3381,Where are your uncles?
3382,He has much more money than I have.
3383,The case is closed.
3384,Do you ever hear from Tom?

3386,My house is close to the school.

3391,It's OK for men to cry.
3392,Tom is not my friend anymore.
3393,Are you still busy?
3394,I'm sure Tom was in Boston at that time.
3395,Winter is approaching.
3396,Tom rushed out of the office.
3397,Tom is the only person who can do this job.
3398,He did not regret his decision.
3399,That's my car.
3400,The ATM is out of order.
3401,Blood is thicker than water.
3402,How long does it take to go from here to the Hilton Hotel?
3403,Please help me.

3405,Tom thought Mary was funny.
3406,Tom hated the idea.
3407,Turtles don't have teeth.
3408,Tom's greedy.
3409,Look that word up in the dictionary.
3410,He knows the art of making people feel at home.
3411,Tom is outraged.
3412,Do you like orange juice?
3413,I love you a lot.
3414,Why are you here?
3415,Tom didn't want to do this for me.
3416,I want rum.
3417,Do you read me?
3418,Find out more about Tom.
3419,"Tom wants to kill you, Mary."
3420,He knows a lot about animals.
3421,I forgot my email address.
3422,Do we have time to finish this before Tom gets here?
3423,Can you smoke here?
3424,Tom isn't as bald as I am.
3425,We fixed that pretty quickly.
3426,I go for a walk every day.
3427,He was drunk and angry.
3428,Could I see your driver's license?
3429,I'm just trying to help out.
3430,Maybe Tom could help.
3431,I'll miss you when you're gone.
3432,Don't panic.
3433,You look really nervous.
3434,That's all I do.
3435,Do you realize what this means?
3436,I'm lucky.
3437,We both cried.
3438,I understand your feelings.
3439,I have to go meet Tom at the mall.
3440,I prefer my own company.
3441,I'm tall.
3442,When are you planning to tell Tom?
3443,He was crying.
3444,You're driving too fast.
3445,This weighs more than the limit.
3446,Tom listened to my opinion.
3447,They filmed the entire ceremony.
3448,I promise you I'll keep you safe.
3449,I almost fell for it.
3450,I have friends in Australia.
3451,Everyone is unique.
3452,Tom wanted to tell you something.
3453,Mary is depressed because Tom broke up with her.
3454,Maybe he liked the idea.
3455,Is that a compliment?
3456,I've had a horrible day.
3457,A curious disease struck the town.
3458,You swim very well.
3459,We ate eggs.
3460,Life isn't easy.
3461,He paid with a credit card.
3462,I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong.
3463,Tom can talk.
3464,It doesn't always happen.
3465,How much money do you want?
3466,Tom has the information Mary needs.
3467,I didn't do what I should've done.
3468,Would you like some more tea?
3469,Who made this possible?
3470,Tom's house has a hidden room.
3471,Tom said that it didn't take him so long to do that.
3472,Who wants more coffee?
3473,I asked Tom for his address.
3474,Tom is walking around.
3475,You don't need to carry lunch with you.
3476,May I borrow this CD?
3477,Let it dry.
3478,We raced toward the fire.
3479,I never use illegal drugs.
3480,Tom didn't know where he was at the time.
3481,Do you have a phone?
3482,I already gave you half.
3483,Smoke rose from the chimney.
3484,My grandfather died in Korea.
3485,I'll tell you the rest of the story tomorrow.
3486,Tom has lied to us.
3487,He is crossing the street now.
3488,He swims better than I do.
3489,Tom moved.
3490,Tom said that Mary had gone to Boston.
3491,Tom cheered Mary on.
3492,Tom wants to pay off his debts.
3493,The boy has a high fever.
3494,Nothing can be worse than that.
3495,Why did you lie to me?
3496,Can you protect me?
3497,What's your nationality?
3498,I lost my job and I have no money. I'm at my wit's end.
3499,How on earth did you get into our room?
3500,How long have we been here?
3501,I was extremely naive at the time.
3502,Why is my blood pressure high?
3503,What do you think of war?
3504,Tom leased an office.
3505,I'm not the owner.
3506,Do you think that Tom will find us?
3507,"Of course, he is right."
3508,The teacher handles his pupils well.
3509,Memorize this.
3510,A year has twelve months.
3511,I read the old documents.
3512,The trouble is that it costs too much.
3513,Tom dumped Mary.
3514,Tom seemed interested in nothing else.
3515,I'll consider it.
3516,We are leaving Japan tomorrow morning.
3517,I received her letter yesterday.
3518,I took time off from work and went to the doctor.
3519,Italian is the language of love.
3520,This must be a mistake.
3521,It's a system that works.
3522,I wish I could go to Japan.
3523,It's started to snow.
3524,Do you forgive me?
3525,Expect the unexpected.
3526,You must remove your shoes before entering a house.
3527,I know Tom is afraid that he'll get fired.
3528,How could you take that job without consulting me?
3529,I won't be quiet.
3530,We knew that in advance.
3531,"Our planet, Earth, is always in motion."
3532,I was unable to write down the number of the car.
3533,I am sure that he will succeed.
3534,I built an amplifier yesterday.
3535,How often do you buy clothes?
3536,My neighbor is a kleptomaniac.
3537,What do you want to do with this?
3538,Please call me Tom.
3539,Tom made pancakes for you.
3540,Quiet down.
3541,Nobody leaves empty handed.
3542,Join us.
3543,That's what I said.
3544,Leave him alone.
3545,It's occupied.
3546,I've lost my sense of smell and taste.
3547,Charlemagne was crowned by the Pope.
3548,It wasn't funny.
3549,I didn't ask Tom for permission to do that.
3550,Don't trust politicians.
3551,They stopped.
3552,He's a volleyball player.
3553,Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
3554,Your guests are waiting.
3555,I never feel at ease in his company.
3556,I do not watch television.
3557,I appreciate all you've done for me.
3558,What's the biggest city in Australia?
3559,I am Chinese.
3560,Do a lot of people live in your town?
3561,I want you to call me ASAP.
3562,"Hey, where are you going?"
3563,Don't throw anything away.
3564,Does anyone else have any suggestions?
3565,Tom is singing.
3566,Tom was angry.
3567,She looked lonely.
3568,My family's not rich.
3569,The public became outraged.
3570,Gravity is the natural force by which objects are attracted to each other.
3571,The dogs are in the garden.

3573,This is alarming.
3574,Tom may come today.
3575,He is wearing gloves.
3576,I don't have to say anything to Tom.
3577,Tom used to be my boyfriend.
3578,She got married without her parents knowing it.
3579,Tell me how Tom and Mary met.
3580,Awesome!
3581,I don't feel like eating out this evening.
3582,Tom has got to get out of here.
3583,That'll end badly.
3584,See you soon!
3585,The cat is eating.
3586,Put it there.
3587,"Hello, girls."
3588,I love hedgehogs.
3589,What are you saying?
3590,I'm sleeping.
3591,I enjoyed myself at the party yesterday.

3597,Did it rain here yesterday?
3598,Some people are afraid of ghosts.
3599,You're repeating yourself.

3602,My eyes watered.
3603,Are you crazy?
3604,Tom is glad he isn't in your shoes.
3605,Who bought that for you?
3606,Don't tell me what's possible.
3607,How many pictures does Tom plan on taking?

3609,How did you make it?
3610,She was injured in the traffic accident.
3611,The girl washed her hair.
3612,She has a very enviable position.
3613,He denied having met her.
3614,Am I the only one who's confused?
3615,I don't know what to do from now on.
3616,Tom doesn't feel like eating.
3617,He turned up 30 minutes late.
3618,There's no reason to get angry.
3619,Be proud of yourself.
3620,Tom is a bad driver.
3621,I'll call you in a couple of days.
3622,Are spiders insects?
3623,When will that occur?
3624,They were troubled deeply by the changes they saw.
3625,I see a man behind the trees.
3626,What's the tallest building in the world?
3627,It's almost six.
3628,You made me happy.
3629,Show yourselves.
3630,It was near the river that I lost my way.
3631,My dream has come true.
3632,I'm an honest person.
3633,I want something to read on the train.
3634,Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that.
3635,I'm not sure if that'll help.
3636,Has Tom eaten?
3637,You may go on condition that you return by five.
3638,This tea tastes good.
3639,Of course.
3640,Turn off the TV.
3641,Where are we right now?
3642,When is the museum open?
3643,Earth is a planet.
3644,Big fish eat small fish.
3645,"I'm fine, thank you."
3646,I'm not normal.
3647,He asked me who I was.
3648,Leave him alone.
3649,What is missing?
3650,"After the hurricane, their house was a wreck."
3651,I thought you said that Tom didn't live in Boston anymore.
3652,I have no idea what Tom said.
3653,This could be disastrous.
3654,I use a measuring cup when baking.
3655,I didn't know that you wanted to do that by yourselves.
3656,Next time I'll come earlier.
3657,There are conditions.
3658,I just borrowed it.
3659,I think you're a liar.
3660,People lie.
3661,This is clearly the best.
3662,Two detectives followed the suspect.
3663,Flattery will get you nowhere.
3664,About thirty people attended Tom's funeral.
3665,Hundreds have been killed.
3666,All the stores were closed.
3667,When will this be acted upon?
3668,I know that you've been studying very hard.
3669,Come home.
3670,Who cares?
3671,Tom will find out sooner or later.
3672,The teacher explained the meaning of the word to us.
3673,Everyone thinks I'm going mad.
3674,I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
3675,He has a house of his own.
3676,He can't handle the truth.
3677,Tom has a sore knee.
3678,Do spiders bite?
3679,I am looking for my friends.
3680,Why don't you ever take me out to dinner?
3681,The European Union has eliminated the death penalty.
3682,Tom's answer was surprising.
3683,I was going to wash my hair.
3684,I don't know how to interpret his words.
3685,Tom says he has everything he needs.
3686,What do you say we call it a day?
3687,Tom doesn't have any drinking water.
3688,Has the Foreign Secretary arrived yet?

3690,Tom wanted to stop Mary.
3691,Tom said that he had given a book to Mary.
3692,We studied Greek culture from various aspects.
3693,You don't seem to be as creative as Tom is.
3694,Tom hesitated to bring up the subject.
3695,I still don't believe it.
3696,A fence runs along the road.
3697,I received your message yesterday.
3698,Does the end justify the means?
3699,They are doctors.
3700,Tom opened the refrigerator.
3701,Why are you all so smartly dressed?
3702,They attempted to assassinate the president.
3703,Is that Tom's father?
3704,Aren't you one of Tom's friends?
3705,Tom and Mary both study French.
3706,Do you own a computer?
3707,I'd like a glass of water.
3708,The butcher is weighing the meat.
3709,Tom is probably going to agree.
3710,Why don't you mind your own business?
3711,I want to go see a movie.
3712,He gave the cat milk.
3713,He became more and more famous.
3714,Where are they swimming?
3715,Was it just a game to you?
3716,I don't know what you mean.
3717,"Even though Tom had promised to pay, he stuck Mary with the bill."
3718,"Unless it rains, I will go, too."
3719,She's the girl of my dreams.
3720,The old man sat all alone.
3721,I love him.
3722,Tom is likely to be through eating by now.
3723,I talked to Tom as well.
3724,I prefer to write in cursive.
3725,That painter is a genius.
3726,Try to be on time tomorrow.
3727,I want to buy a shirt for my sister.
3728,I'm sure you're very busy.
3729,I haven't seen anything yet.
3730,Tom never wears pink clothes.

3732,I found the key that I'd been looking for.
3733,How much money does he make a month?
3734,The car is ready.
3735,I'm not tired at all.
3736,Tom had a small box in his hand.
3737,I think that I've lost my keys.
3738,I like him.
3739,See you!
3740,Why are you here when you should be in school?
3741,When can you come over?
3742,Don't you have anything nice to say?
3743,He believes in Santa Claus.
3744,I sell coffee.
3745,She must have gone out.
3746,It's a piece of cake.
3747,Who is this woman?
3748,It sounds like you've had a bad day.
3749,His new record sells well.
3750,It's seven o'clock.
3751,She took care of his wound.
3752,The wall has been painted yellow.
3753,I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary didn't do that.
3754,He speaks French.
3755,We always have options.
3756,It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
3757,"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it."
3758,I never heard him sing.
3759,I can't think of everything.
3760,He hid behind the door.
3761,Everybody laughs.
3762,There's something I need to show you.
3763,I don't think that I have a problem.
3764,The wine Tom gave me was very good.
3765,Write Tom.
3766,I do love flowers.
3767,Please don't use more water than you need.

4297,Never mind what she said.

4300,Welcome home.
4301,I trained Tom.
4302,I didn't mean to hurt you.
4303,They went to the beach.
4304,I wonder how Tom is going to react.
4305,I don't have any problem with that.
4306,He'll try to find everything out.
4307,That felt like an earthquake.
4308,I thought that you said you used to live in Boston.
4309,That's Tom's dog.
4310,That's none of your business.
4311,Tom married Mary.
4312,The dog was busy burying his bone in the garden.
4313,I told Tom I'd made a mistake.

4316,He sounds angry.
4317,My grandmother loves watching TV.

4320,What have we done?
4321,Tom's very dangerous.
4322,Which is the more expensive of the two?
4323,I want to know how they do that.
4324,Tom needs the money right away.
4325,Fill the bottle with water.
4326,You don't seem to be nervous.
4327,You must go to the dentist.
4328,The driver was charged with speeding.
4329,We're happy.
4330,Sit up straight.
4331,I don't know how to pronounce Tom's last name.
4332,This gift is for you.
4333,Haven't you eaten lunch yet?
4334,You've made a mistake.
4335,I try.
4336,Get a haircut.
4337,It's not like it used to be.
4338,There is one apple on the desk.
4339,No one was present at the meeting.
4340,My pen has been stolen.
4341,That's all true.
4342,Did you get my letter?
4343,Let's not take that risk.
4344,Why are you so disappointed?
4345,I thought that I was doing you a favor.
4346,He hesitated for a moment.

4376,Will you go by train?
4377,Tom took a sip of wine and frowned.
4378,Where are your children?
4379,I hear that you're very talented.
4380,I didn't need to know that.
4381,"I'm Mary's friend, Tom."
4382,The pond is 100 meters in diameter.
4383,I don't think that Tom would like living here.
4384,Tom respects your opinion.
4385,I want to see him at all costs.

4387,I wanted to talk with you alone.
4388,"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
4389,Tom has a nose ring.
4390,Which car is Tom's?
4391,Do you guys get along?

4403,He hesitated for a while.
4404,Tom came to the party with his new girlfriend.
4405,I plan to stay there one week.
4406,Quit bothering me.
4407,I think there's a misunderstanding.
4408,I thought you said you didn't smoke.
4409,Let me add water.
4410,What keeps you motivated?
4411,We don't sell what you're looking for.
4412,I'll wait until three o'clock.
4413,Our world is getting smaller and smaller.

4471,Do you want us to go with you?
4472,Let us talk to Tom.
4473,He told his children not to make so much noise.
4474,What's your girlfriend's name?
4475,"Clearly, that wasn't the case."
4476,Nobody's going to believe this.

4506,I feel strongly that men and women are equal.

4523,"What's that sound? ""It sounds like a woodpecker."""

4528,I can still see my mother's face.
4529,I cannot fix the computer.
4530,It made no difference.
4531,That's a really wonderful plan.
4532,I'm not your girlfriend.
4533,I don't think Tom likes Mary very much.
4534,Tom didn't want to talk about that over the phone.
4535,Taxi fares will go up next month.

4553,How long have you been using this toothbrush?
4554,I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
4555,How much is that going to cost me?

4558,Nothing out of the ordinary happened on our trip.
4559,I can't remember the last time I had a martini.
4560,The road is blocked because of an accident.
4561,I wish you'd make up your mind.
4562,You're lying.
4563,Tom is a hero.

4565,This isn't a fish.
4566,I'd like to book a double room.
4567,Tom is at the laundromat.
4568,You're rich.

4581,Why would I take your car keys?
4582,Please hurry!
4583,I saw a doe.
4584,Why am I always the one who has to suffer?
4585,He turned up half an hour late.
4586,Are you a doctor?
4587,I didn't get home until 2:30.
4588,Do you like folk music?

4590,I can't afford to buy a used car.
4591,What've you guys been doing?
4592,Tom is a sourpuss.
4593,The Internet is now something we can't live without.

4595,I forgot to bring my umbrella with me.
4596,I've met Tom before.
4597,I'm about to go.
4598,This music suits my present mood.
4599,We have half a dozen eggs.
4600,I didn't know you used to do that when you lived in Australia.
4601,How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital?
4602,Tom really likes going to the movies.
4603,We're good cooks.
4604,Are my eyes red?
4605,I get what you're saying.
4606,I love my job.
4607,I have to move.
4608,Tom made a decision.

4610,Do you want to go?

4624,I know you are rich.
4625,We have to get ready for next week.

4639,For some reason the microphone wasn't working until now.
4640,Tom was quite frustrated.
4641,I am eating fruit.
4642,Tom is going to join us for lunch.
4643,Why don't you ever smile?
4644,"Let's do it again, guys."
4645,Fry me some eggs.
4646,I understand everything you said.

4676,The view from the summit is very nice.

4681,I think I understand.
4682,It's Greek to me.
4683,Tom still has a lot of apples.
4684,"As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep."

4686,What's the fastest way to get to the zoo?
4687,It must be a virus.
4688,"Tom is intelligent, isn't he?"
4689,I like you.
4690,My dog is cute.
4691,He's a drama queen.
4692,It wasn't my fault.

4706,My left foot is asleep.
4707,I can't find the shovel.
4708,I want to know more about you.

4711,This is a complex question.
4712,When can you come over?
4713,My hair was brown before it turned gray.
4714,The rain lasted the whole night.
4715,What were you doing at this time last year?
4716,Who said that it would be easy?
4717,No one has been injured yet.
4718,Nobody knows you're here.
4719,Tom helped me with my homework.
4720,There's no way around that.
4721,You earned it.
4722,It was freezing!
4723,Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
4724,"Merry Christmas, everybody!"
4725,I'm not leaving Tom here by himself.
4726,Who do you work for?
4727,I have no permanent residence.
4728,May I drink alcohol?
4729,The little girl hid in the closet.
4730,They said that.
4731,Is everything ready for tomorrow?

4754,There's a math test tomorrow.
4755,There's no reason to panic.
4756,He has a beard.
4757,He was too old to swim.
4758,The whole team needs to be there.
4759,We have no other option.

4761,Are you surprised?
4762,"Copy this, please."
4763,Its color is yellow.
4764,That bottle is full.
4765,Knowledge is power.
4766,I owe him 10 dollars.
4767,Mushrooms are a kind of fungus.
4768,I wonder why Tom didn't tell the truth.
4769,She met him three years ago.
4770,That's none of your concern.
4771,I mean what I say.
4772,"I need pens, notebooks and so on."
4773,Tom bought some batteries.
4774,It's nobody's fault.
4775,"I can't sleep. ""Me neither."""

4778,It's a lot later than you think.
4779,I worked on a farm.
4780,I arrived too early.
4781,Have you answered that letter yet?
4782,You arrived just in time.
4783,Tom must do it now.
4784,Shut up and listen to me.
4785,Tom wrote down the license plate number.
4786,I didn't write this letter.
4787,I felt so helpless.
4788,I wasn't in yesterday afternoon.
4789,The world is a dangerous place.
4790,I thought Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him.

4809,You're probably right again.
4810,I'm quite good at tennis.
4811,Should I stay or go?
4812,He's happy.
4813,He came into the room.
4814,That is mine. I don't know where his is.
4815,Where's Tom been?
4816,I live in the city.

5349,I'm so happy that you're here.
5350,Tom is going to stay at a friend's house for a few days.
5351,Tom watered the roses.
5352,I read your letter to my family.
5353,Let's listen.
5354,You can leave me alone.
5355,Do you watch television?
5356,I'm on my honeymoon.
5357,All that you have to do is to wait for his reply.
5358,Tom said nobody was hurt.
5359,Tom needs time.
5360,Tom said that he couldn't remember where he'd parked the car.
5361,Tom isn't back yet.
5362,Tom has been gaining weight.
5363,Stay behind me.
5364,I rode a unicycle today.
5365,I was late for the appointment.
5366,Tom says he has something important to tell you.
5367,"I don't know if it was because of the late hour or because of the rain, but there was no one around."
5368,Tom is one of the best skateboarders I know.
5369,That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
5370,Tom stole my umbrella.
5371,Tom never really wanted to sell his house.
5372,Write your name in capital letters.
5373,I'm assuming that it won't be a problem.
5374,"I asked for an appointment, but he wouldn't spare me the time."
5375,Why is Tom crying?
5376,Europe is in crisis.
5377,I knew it all along.
5378,Is it your bike?
5379,Tom's out of a job.
5380,I've only written three songs so far this year.
5381,She sewed a button on her coat.
5382,I've always lived in Australia.

5384,Tom had breakfast alone.
5385,I'll handle it later.
5386,It's my brother's.
5387,Tom is just like us.
5388,Where does Tom eat breakfast?
5389,I don't have time for you.
5390,She killed herself yesterday.
5391,It's your only chance.
5392,I have nothing to do with the affair.
5393,Your lips are red.
5394,I want a new lamp.
5395,Watch out! Tom has a gun.
5396,Why do you always wake up in a bad mood?
5397,You're not old.
5398,He is able to recite the Koran.
5399,I wish Tom were here.
5400,Even intelligent people are sometimes absent-minded.
5401,We've seen enough.
5402,I hope that Tom didn't take that too hard.
5403,Tom doesn't want to break up with Mary.
5404,They attained their aim.
5405,Today is your birthday.
5406,I have to hurry.
5407,The poor girl went blind.
5408,It's easy for me.
5409,He has brown eyes.
5410,He is only a child.
5411,"In order to sprout, seeds need air and water."
5412,I think being poor is nothing to be ashamed of.
5413,What kind of stuff do you want?
5414,It's so nice to be back.
5415,The post office is closed on Christmas day and mail will not be delivered.
5416,I didn't get Tom's joke.
5417,I just told Tom he doesn't have to help me on Monday.
5418,This skirt is a little too tight.
5419,I know Tom knew who did that for you.
5420,It wasn't my fault.
5421,Tom is a real cowboy.
5422,I have a computer.
5423,Do you like Australia?
5424,Tom seems to be getting fatter.
5425,What classes did you have today?
5426,I have two cousins.
5427,My hands are dirty.
5428,Tom was obviously high.
5429,I pretended that I was sleeping.
5430,Tom's idea seemed good to me.
5431,"Next time, ask me before you use my car."
5432,You're so impatient with me.
5433,Go away.
5434,"If I were you, I'd go home early."
5435,I read a letter.
5436,I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
5437,I gave Tom a fake address.
5438,I heard everything you just said.
5439,Tom is completely bald.
5440,I read your book.
5441,I don't have any friends here in Boston.
5442,I think that Tom and Mary both have a drinking problem.
5443,"By the way, have you heard from him lately?"
5444,Tom said that he didn't want to sit next to me.
5445,I'm not sure of it either.
5446,Don't come here.
5447,Stop the car.
5448,Does Tom like Australia?
5449,Who's your teacher?
5450,Have you ever slipped on a banana peel?
5451,Tom is alone in the house.
5452,Tom betrayed Mary.
5453,"Well, stranger things have happened."
5454,What Tom told me is hard to believe.
5455,Everybody needs a hobby.
5456,My apartment is on the fourth floor.
5457,Tom and I are both on the same team.
5458,He may have been ill.
5459,Could you show me that?
5460,I've learned a lot.
5461,I knew Tom wouldn't do what we asked.
5462,Are you satisfied now?
5463,She's only a child.
5464,Drive slowly.
5465,Tom ate his vegetables.
5466,What year were you born?
5467,"I can hope for a miracle, can't I?"
5468,My eyes aren't blue.
5469,You can always count on us.
5470,He has no children.
5471,Tom is arguing with somebody.
5472,My family and I live in Boston.
5473,I've already told you what's happening.
5474,Spring will be here soon.
5475,How's your little sister?
5476,I assure you that an error like this will never happen again.
5477,Have you been feeling sick?
5478,Tom heard Mary climbing the stairs.
5479,We've got a meeting with Tom today.
5480,Please tell me your present address.
5481,I didn't understand a single word.
5482,I like this blue dress.
5483,That was only a year ago.
5484,We hope that you can help us.
5485,It's hot in this room.
5486,I don't love her anymore.
5487,Tom kicked the door down.
5488,You are taller than she is.
5489,Today's friends are tomorrow's enemies.
5490,Tom couldn't believe nobody laughed at his jokes.
5491,I don't know any Canadians.
5492,I'm speaking.
5493,He's afraid of the sea.
5494,You'll never guess what happened.
5495,Her father is a policeman.
5496,She deliberately exposed him to danger.
5497,How many Christmas cards did you send?
5498,This gate allows access to the garden.
5499,"You know many interesting places, don't you?"
5500,He hardly ever works.
5501,The bird had a broken wing.
5502,I'm going to see him tomorrow.
5503,How often do you have parties?
5504,Tom's got a weight problem.
5505,I reluctantly agreed.
5506,Five plus two equals seven.
5507,I've never seen anything quite like it.
5508,It's across the street.
5509,Is that your new girlfriend?
5510,Give me another beer.
5511,"You can do whatever you want to do, of course."
5512,I am eating rice.
5513,Tom asked Mary where she usually went shopping.
5514,Mary is at home with her husband.
5515,I'm counting on you guys.
5516,Has he arrived yet?
5517,I hope to see you soon.
5518,It's already too late.
5519,My grandmother likes to sew.
5520,This piece of music is way too difficult for me to play.
5521,This is really gross.
5522,She began crying.
5523,Tom continued his story.
5524,Help me.
5525,This is the worst storm in ten years.
5526,What he said was far from true.
5527,Tom complained about the heat.
5528,I want my money back now.
5529,We go fishing once in a while.
5530,I'm a fairly fast swimmer.
5531,"Tom is hungry and I am, too."
5532,Tom opened his mouth.
5533,I'm very surprised that Tom didn't want to do that.
5534,Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
5535,I had a guilty conscience.
5536,These oranges taste good.
5537,He carries a bag on his back.
5538,You can trust him.
5539,Who fell?
5540,I am not curious.
5541,Do you guys smoke?
5542,I found the test difficult.
5543,I don't really see what the problem is.
5544,The pain was unbearable.
5545,It's already time to go home.
5546,They are all very happy.
5547,Where did you find these rare stamps?
5548,Who stands to benefit most?
5549,I don't know who painted this picture.
5550,I told Tom it wasn't mine.
5551,Is the window open?
5552,The accident took place the day before yesterday.
5553,Those boots are mine.
5554,How long will you stay here?
5555,You could've fooled me.
5556,I'm afraid the line is busy.
5557,Tom is a Virgo.
5558,We felt sick.
5559,The tank is full.
5560,I sometimes do that in the morning.
5561,I have a dentist appointment.
5562,You're just as bad as Tom.
5563,Bread has gone up ten yen in price.
5564,What a bizarre story!
5565,I don't have a car now.
5566,"If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to let me know."
5567,"If Tom goes, I'll go with him."
5568,Tom counted on Mary's help.
5569,We ate potato soup.
5570,Shouldn't you be in bed?
5571,May I ask who you are?
5572,I can't breathe through my nose.
5573,The hours are terrible.
5574,How many languages do you speak?
5575,Thanks!

5594,I know it was serious.
5595,Tom will try to contact you.
5596,I woke up just before Tom did.
5597,I have a headache.
5598,Tom went back home to put on some dry clothes.
5599,She disappeared in the dark.
5600,We're not on the same team.
5601,"No matter what happens, just keep smiling."

5603,I can't stand that man.
5604,What's this called?
5605,How come you never told me you were from Boston?
5606,How do you want your steak?
5607,We should lay down a few ground rules before we begin.
5608,How much is this camera?
5609,Those who use forks or chopsticks often think people who don't are uncivilized.

7456,Perhaps it'll rain in the afternoon.
7457,Why should we get involved?
7458,I'd like a piña colada.
7459,I decided to stay here.
7460,Tom ran as quickly as he could.
7461,Did you know Tom had a twin brother?
7462,I really want to learn French.
7463,This is the only way out.
7464,I cannot stand this heat.
7465,I never thought that this could happen.
7466,I'm dizzy.
7467,That fish isn't edible.
7468,Can I bring my friend with me?
7469,What do you want me to say?
7470,Tom told Mary that he didn't think he'd be able to do that today.
7471,Did you ski last winter?
7472,Smartphones would have seemed like science fiction ten years ago.
7473,Thank you for the present you gave my son.
7474,Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
7475,The cheese was delicious.
7476,Tom is going to play tennis tomorrow.
7477,You aren't under any obligation to do that.
7478,A home is more than a mere building.
7479,"The number is 932-8647, but I don't know the area code."
7480,Tom didn't even have time to eat a quick lunch.
7481,The good news is Tom can still walk.
7482,I don't understand what happened.
7483,Tom told me he'd left his wife.
7484,Tom decided to try sleeping without a pillow.
7485,Ladies first.
7486,Birds make their nests in trees.
7487,It's rude to make fun of your boss in public.
7488,There is a possibility it will snow tonight.
7489,We are sick.
7490,Do you cry often?
7491,There's a spring in the center of the village.
7492,Is it a bomb?
7493,Tom and Mary are the only survivors.
7494,"Sorry, I don't think I can do it."
7495,Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
7496,These glasses are beautiful.
7497,I want to take a walk.
7498,I know Tom is making spaghetti.
7499,Superman flies as fast as a rocket.
7500,Look at it this way.
7501,He is afraid that he will die.
7502,Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
7503,I eat here.
7504,Frogs are afraid of snakes.
7505,Who knows where Tom went?
7506,The spider is spinning a web.
7507,I don't know who those people are.
7508,Tom is afraid to say anything.
7509,I had an idea.
7510,I'd rather do it myself.
7511,Tom must be found immediately.
7512,Squirrels eat hazelnuts.
7513,Tom pulled his shirt up over his head.
7514,Nothing has changed.
7515,You should be there.
7516,It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
7517,Tom wants you to leave.
7518,I'm off beer.
7519,She told me about what she saw in Australia.
7520,Tom fell into a deep sleep.
7521,India is the seventh largest country in the world.
7522,This is a joke.
7523,I met my teacher on the way to the station.
7524,I need a toothpick.
7525,Are you through with your homework?
7526,Tom must've been asleep.
7527,The pigeons' feathers are white.
7528,I eat dinner at quarter past seven.
7529,Tom was the only one who wasn't at the party.
7530,I'm glad Tom and I are making progress.
7531,Tom was one of them.
7532,Tom skied all day.
7533,I'm sleepy.
7534,He grabbed me by the collar.
7535,What are you smiling about?
7536,These dirty socks stink.
7537,The ring couldn't be found anywhere.
7538,They're gone.
7539,"Tom took more than one picture, didn't he?"
7540,The doorbell is ringing.
7541,It was mandatory.
7542,I have been studying it for five years.
7543,I know I'm going to regret this.
7544,Tom poured some apple juice into a glass.
7545,Tom said he wanted to learn French.
7546,I want you to read this book.
7547,Did you see Tom arrive?
7548,"Tom has money. However, he's not all that happy."
7549,Our team won yesterday.
7550,Draw me a sheep.
7551,I didn't want to alarm you.
7552,I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
7553,How's life here?
7554,What's your password?
7555,You never know when an earthquake will happen.
7556,You can't have your cake and eat it too.
7557,Wait a second.
7558,The old man stood on the hill.
7559,"Tom, wait!"
7560,It's just a bird.
7561,Let's go drinking together tonight.
7562,I knew this would happen.
7563,Don't take candy from strangers.
7564,She left.
7565,My bag is over there.
7566,Aren't you afraid to die?
7567,Look at all those ants.
7568,I need a medic.
7569,Your letter made me happy.
7570,Tom isn't my boyfriend.
7571,You're so sweet.
7572,I wasn't the only one who failed.
7573,"Seen at a distance, the rock looks like a squatting human figure."
7574,That's a pretty necklace.
7575,I've bought a car.
7576,I'm skeptical.
7577,How can I protect myself?
7578,I can't go on Monday.
7579,Tom is three inches shorter than Mary.
7580,Tom used to be poor.
7581,I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
7582,I doubt the truth of his story.
7583,We ran after the cat.
7584,I haven't seen you guys in a while.
7585,Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
7586,I already feel better about that.
7587,Have you lost weight?
7588,We stayed there for three months.
7589,Tom thought he was going to die.
7590,Don't spill the beans.
7591,I've read the report.
7592,We have a lot of work to do.
7593,You never forget how to ride a bike.
7594,Tom's plan went horribly wrong.
7595,I can't help anyone today.
7596,I figured it would be difficult to do.
7597,There's no cure.
7598,It was dark when I reached the hotel.
7599,The dog is barking.
7600,He decided to marry her.
7601,Tom wasn't safe.
7602,Mother bought a beautiful doll for her.
7603,Don't worry about your family.
7604,I want a dog.
7605,You should've listened to me.
7606,Our goal is to win a gold medal.
7607,Who came?
7608,I'm glad I've finally caught you.
7609,This watch is waterproof.
7610,We need to protect you.
7611,This meat is chicken.
7612,We didn't see anything.
7613,I love Tom's eyes.
7614,It's all the same to me.
7615,I've never lied to Tom.
7616,What time is it over there?
7617,I'm finished eating.
7618,Tom loves math.
7619,I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive.
7620,The ship dropped anchor.
7621,"Where there's a will, there's a way."
7622,"I want to go home. ""So do I."""
